# ROADMAP — Wasserstoffinfrastruktur in globalen Lieferketten

**Project:** Bachelor Thesis on Hydrogen Infrastructure in Global Supply Chains
**Language:** German (thesis output) | English (interaction)
**Duration:** ~5 months (14 days Exposé + 4 months thesis after professor approval)
**Methodology:** GSD (Get Shit Done) with 14-day sprints

## Project Vision

**Objective:** Create a high-quality Exposé for professor approval, followed by a comprehensive bachelor thesis analyzing the regulatory, logistical, and technical barriers to global hydrogen infrastructure deployment, with evidence-based implementation strategies.

**Core Value:** Synthesize fragmented global research on hydrogen infrastructure into an actionable framework that bridges the "chicken-and-egg" problem between supply and demand.
