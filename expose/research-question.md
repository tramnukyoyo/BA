# Research Question Definition

## Primary Research Question (RQ)

*(To be finalized after literature review)*

**Working RQ:** What are the critical regulatory, logistical, and technical barriers preventing global hydrogen infrastructure deployment, and what implementation strategies can overcome them?

---

## Sub-Questions

1. **Regulatory:** Which regulatory frameworks and standards need harmonization to enable international hydrogen infrastructure?

2. **Logistical:** What are the optimal transport modes and storage solutions for hydrogen within global supply chains given current technical constraints?

3. **Technical:** What infrastructure investments (production, compression, transport, refueling) are required to reach critical mass?

4. **Economic:** What are the cost structures and financial models for sustainable hydrogen infrastructure deployment?

5. **Implementation:** Which pilot projects and rollout strategies show the highest feasibility for rapid, scalable deployment?

## Scope Definition

### IN SCOPE
- Global hydrogen supply chain (production → distribution → refueling)
- Regulatory frameworks (EU, USA, China, emerging economies)
- Logistical and technical barriers
- Implementation strategies and pilot projects
- Cost analysis and financial models

### OUT OF SCOPE
- Green hydrogen production technologies (solar, wind, electrolysis only briefly)
- Hydrogen end-user applications (fuel cells, industry, power)
- Historical evolution of hydrogen use
- Climate change mitigation policy (background context only)

## Core Challenges to Address

1. **Regulatory Fragmentation** — No unified global standards
2. **Infrastructure Investment Gap** — High capex, uncertain demand
3. **Technical Immaturity** — Storage, compression, transport still developing
4. **Economic Viability** — Cost parity with fossil fuels unclear
5. **Coordination Failure** — Chicken-egg problem (supply needs demand, demand needs supply)

## Thesis Contribution

The thesis will synthesize global perspectives on hydrogen infrastructure challenges and propose implementation strategies grounded in case studies and expert analysis.
