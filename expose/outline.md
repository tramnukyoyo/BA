# Exposé Outline — Hydrogen Infrastructure in Global Supply Chains

## Structure

### 1. Motivation & Problem Statement (250 words)
- Why hydrogen matters (climate, energy transition, industrial demand)
- Current state of hydrogen infrastructure (fragmented, nascent)
- The gap: potential vs. deployment reality

### 2. Research Question(s) (150 words)
- Primary RQ: Barriers and implementation strategies
- Sub-questions: regulatory, logistical, technical, economic, implementation

### 3. Literature Review / Existing Knowledge (300 words)
- Current hydrogen infrastructure status (EU, USA, China, emerging)
- Known barriers: regulatory, technical, economic, logistical
- Existing solution proposals and pilot projects
- Gap: missing integration across supply chain perspectives

### 4. Research Methodology (250 words)
- Literature-based analysis with case study approach
- Phase 1: Identify and synthesize barriers (systematic literature review)
- Phase 2: Analyze implementation cases (3-5 pilot/regional projects)
- Phase 3: Propose integrated framework for strategy

### 5. Expected Outcomes (200 words)
- Comprehensive taxonomy of infrastructure barriers
- Case-based implementation strategies
- Roadmap for global hydrogen infrastructure development
- Recommendations for policy, industry, research

### 6. Timeline for Full Thesis (150 words)
- Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Complete literature review, define framework
- Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Deep-dive case studies
- Phase 3 (Months 3-4): Synthesis, recommendations, writing
- Phase 4 (Months 4-5): Revision and finalization
