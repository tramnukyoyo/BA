## DETAILED EVALUATIONS

### ✅ PAPER 1: Raeesi et al. 2024

**Paper:** Hydrogen supply chain and refuelling network design: assessment of alternative scenarios for the long-haul road freight in the UK
**Authors:** Ramin Raeesi, Christa Searle, Nazmiye Balta-Ozkan, Laura Marsiliani, Mi Tian, Philip Greening
**Journal:** International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
**Year:** 2024
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.474
**Citations:** 14
**Content Area:** 1 (Supply Chain Integration)

#### Evaluation
- ✅ Peer-reviewed: YES — Int. J. Hydrogen Energy (top-tier)
- ✅ Recency: YES — 2024 (within 2019-2025)
- ✅ HRS-specific: YES — Title explicitly "hydrogen refuelling network design"
- ✅ Methodology: YES — "Assessment of alternative scenarios" indicates structured analysis
- ✅ Citation strength: GOOD — 2024 with 14 citations (meets 5+ minimum, respectable for recent)
- ✅ Reference list: LIKELY 40-60 citations (typical for supply chain papers)
- ❌ Review: NO — Original research with case study

#### Content Fit
- ✅ Perfect fit for Content Area 1: "Supply chain" + "refuelling network design" explicitly mentioned
- ✅ HRS-specific: YES — About hydrogen supply chains to refueling infrastructure, not general H₂
- ✅ Empirical data: YES — Real UK case study for long-haul road freight
- ✅ Thesis relevance: YES — Directly addresses supply chain integration and logistical scenarios

**Decision: ✅ ACCEPT**

**Why:** Excellent paper for Content Area 1. Addresses end-to-end hydrogen supply chain with real UK case study. Directly supports thesis focus areas of supply chain integration and logistical scenarios. Alternative scenario assessment aligns well with thesis methodology on comparing integration scenarios (Corridor, Cluster, Hub models).

### ⚠️ PAPER 2: Isaac & Saha 2023 — ATTENTION!

**Paper:** A Review of the Optimization Strategies and Methods Used to Locate Hydrogen Fuel Refueling Stations
**Authors:** Nithin Isaac, Akshay K. Saha
**Journal:** Energies (MDPI)
**Year:** 2023
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/en16052171
**Citations:** 44
**Content Area:** 2 (Logistical & Technical Challenges) — **BUT USER MISASSIGNED**

#### Evaluation Note
This paper was **already accepted for Content Area 3 (Spatial Planning)** in earlier evaluation. The title is about **"Locate Hydrogen Fuel Refueling Stations"** — this is a spatial/location optimization paper, NOT a logistical/technical challenges paper.

**Decision: ⚠️ RELOCATE — DO NOT USE FOR CONTENT AREA 2**

**Why:** While this is an excellent paper (review format, 44 citations, HRS-specific), it addresses location optimization strategies, not operational/technical/logistical challenges. Content Area 2 requires papers on barriers, operational issues, maintenance, transport logistics — not site selection. **Keep this paper for Content Area 3, not Area 2.**

**Action required:** Find a different paper for Content Area 2 (Logistical & Technical Challenges) that addresses operational barriers, transport logistics, technical reliability issues, or deployment challenges.

### ⚠️ PAPER 10: Kim et al. 2023 — NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Paper:** Review of hydrogen infrastructure: The current status and roll-out strategy
**Authors:** Changjong Kim, Sang Hoon Cho, Sung Min Cho, Youngseung Na, Sangwon Kim, Dong Kyu Kim
**Journal:** International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
**Year:** 2023
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.053
**Citations:** 128
**Content Area:** 10 (EU Policy & Institutional Context)

#### Evaluation
- ✅ Peer-reviewed: YES — Int. J. Hydrogen Energy
- ✅ Recency: YES — 2023
- ⚠️ HRS-specific: UNCERTAIN — Title says "hydrogen infrastructure" (could be broad), but may focus on HRS deployment
- ✅ Methodology: YES — "Review" format suggests systematic analysis
- ✅ Citation strength: EXCELLENT — 2023 with 128 citations (far exceeds thresholds)
- ✅ Reference list: LIKELY 100+ citations (typical for review papers)
- ✅ Review: YES — Explicitly "Review" format (BONUS)

#### Content Fit — ⚠️ UNCERTAIN
- ❓ Content area: "Current status and roll-out strategy" could be global, EU-specific, or regional
- ❓ HRS-specific: Title doesn't explicitly mention HRS (says "hydrogen infrastructure" generically)
- ⚠️ EU focus: Title does NOT mention EU, AFIR, TEN-T, or European policy

**Decision: ⚠️ SHORTLIST** — **VERIFICATION REQUIRED BEFORE FINAL DECISION**

**Why:** Excellent metrics (128 citations, review format, 2023), BUT uncertain fit for Content Area 10 (EU Policy & Institutional Context). Title "Review of hydrogen infrastructure: current status and roll-out strategy" is broad and doesn't specify EU policy focus. The paper may be:
1. Global review of HRS status → Better for Content Area 8 (Global Market Insights)
2. Asian focus (likely Korea-centric given author names) → Better for Content Area 8
3. Comprehensive review of HRS technology → Better for Content Area 9

**RECOMMENDED ACTION:**
- **Option A:** Verify if this paper specifically discusses EU policy, AFIR regulation, TEN-T corridors, or EU subsidy programs. If yes, ACCEPT for Area 10. If no, MOVE to Area 8 or 9.
- **Option B:** If this paper doesn't cover EU policy, SEARCH for dedicated EU HRS policy paper (try queries like "EU AFIR" + "hydrogen refueling," "TEN-T" + "hydrogen infrastructure," "European hydrogen policy," or "hydrogen strategy EU").

## GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### ❌ CRITICAL GAP: Content Area 2 (Logistical & Technical Challenges)

No acceptable paper found yet. This content area requires papers specifically addressing:
- Operational barriers and challenges for HRS deployment
- Technical challenges (compressor reliability, cooling, storage technology)
- Logistical challenges in hydrogen transport to stations (truck vs. pipeline vs. on-site)
- Maintenance requirements and reliability issues

**ACTION:** Execute targeted searches using Content Area 2 queries from EXACT_SEARCH_QUERIES.md:
```
"hydrogen refueling station" AND ("challenges" OR "barriers") AND ("technical" OR "logistical")
"HRS" AND ("deployment challenges" OR "implementation barriers")
"hydrogen fueling station" AND ("technical challenges" OR "operational issues" OR "maintenance")
```

### ⚠️ UNCERTAIN: Content Area 10 (EU Policy & Institutional Context)

Paper 10 (Kim et al. 2023) has strong metrics but uncertain EU-policy focus. Before finalizing:
1. Check if paper discusses EU regulations, AFIR, TEN-T, or European subsidy programs
2. If yes → ACCEPT for Area 10
3. If no → SEARCH for dedicated EU policy papers on AFIR regulation, TEN-T corridors, or EU hydrogen strategy
