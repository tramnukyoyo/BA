3. **Paper 4 - EU Strategy** — Foundation for regional comparison
4. **Paper 5 - EU Roadmap** — Complements EU strategy with infrastructure detail

**Medium Priority (Strengthens analysis):**
5. **Paper 9 - Supply Chain Integration** — Links production to HRS deployment
6. **Paper 13 - Asia-Pacific Comparison** — Regional benchmarking (Japan, Korea, Australia)
7. **Paper 14 - EU Supply Chain** — Regional benchmarking (Europe)
8. **Paper 15 - Multi-Regional Comparison** — Enables systematic benchmarking across all 3 regions

**Lower Priority (Fill gaps after core papers):**
9. **Paper 1 - IEA Outlook** — Provides global context
10. **Paper 2 - Prokopou HRS Optimization** — Technical depth (if needed)
11. **Paper 3 - Eißler HRS Costs** — Economic data (if needed)
12. **Paper 8 - AFIR Regulation** — Regulatory details (if needed)
13. **Paper 12 - Scenarios** — If you want to model multiple deployment options

## HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST

### When You Find a Paper:

1. **Search Google Scholar, ResearchGate, institutional repositories**
2. **Download PDF and name it clearly** (e.g., `AuthorYear_Topic.pdf`)
3. **Place in** `C:\Users\denny\Bachelorarbeit\literature\`
4. **Update this checklist:**
   - Change status from "PENDING" to "✅ FOUND"
   - Check the ☑ in "Found" column
   - Add filename and source in "Notes"

### When You Want Me to Review:

1. **Tell me:** "I found Paper X, it's in literature folder"
2. **I will:**
   - Read the PDF
   - Verify it matches the intended thesis component
   - Assess quality and relevance
   - Confirm it should go in your bibliography
   - Extract key metadata for Harvard citation

3. **Then:**
   - I'll update this checklist with ✔ REVIEWED status
   - I'll provide citation data
   - I'll flag any issues or concerns

---

## REVIEW TEMPLATE (I'll use this for each paper you submit)

When you submit a paper, I'll provide feedback like:

```
REVIEW: [Author Year — Title]

✅ CONFIRMED: Paper 6 (METI Japan Strategy)
- Thesis component: Regional Strategy — Japan
- Quality: Official government document, authoritative
- Relevance: HIGH — Core regional comparison data
- Harvard citation: [generated]
- Status: ✔ REVIEWED, Ready to add to bibliography
- Notes: Essential for Asia-Pacific regional benchmarking
```

or

```
⚠️ PARTIAL MATCH: [Title]
- Thesis component: Claimed to be Paper X, but better fits Paper Y
- Quality: Peer-reviewed, good
- Relevance: MEDIUM — Useful but not primary focus
- Recommendation: Add as supporting source, not core paper
```

or

```
✖️ DOES NOT FIT: [Title]
- Reason: Focuses on hydrogen production, not infrastructure deployment
- Quality: Good paper, but outside thesis scope
- Recommendation: Skip (or note as related-but-excluded)
```

---

## SUPPORTING SOURCES (15-25 additional papers)

Beyond the 15 core papers, you'll also need 15-25 supporting papers from categories like:

- **Additional barrier analyses** (regulatory, technical, economic, logistical)
- **Regional hydrogen strategies** (Germany, UK, other EU countries; more on Japan/Korea/Australia)
- **HRS case studies** (existing projects, deployment lessons)
- **Supply chain analyses** (different transport modes: pipeline, maritime, truck, LOHC)
- **Policy mechanisms** (subsidies, carbon pricing, international trade frameworks)
- **Technology cost curves** (electrolyzer, compression, storage price trends)
- **Feasibility studies** (specific region or corridor analyses)

**I will track these separately as "Supporting Sources" — you don't need to find them all now, but keep adding them as you search.**
