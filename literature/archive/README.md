# Literature Archive

**Status:** Phase 1 Rebuild (HRS-specific focus) — Old papers archived

This folder contains **10 old papers** from the original Phase 1 work. They were archived because:
- Original exposé addressed "general hydrogen infrastructure" (too broad)
- Current thesis focuses specifically on **Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS)**
- These papers are not HRS-specific, but kept as reference/supplementary material

## Archived Papers (10)

1. **Eißler2023** — Detailed Cost Analysis of HRS (HRS-related, but may not meet new quality criteria)
2. **Vizza2025** — Cost Optimal Design of PV-Driven Hydrogen (renewable energy focus)
3. **METI Japan2023** — Strategic Roadmap for Hydrogen (general H₂ policy, not HRS)
4. **ECH2A2023** — Hydrogen Standardisation Roadmap (standards, not HRS-specific)
5. **European Commission2020** — Hydrogen Strategy (general strategy, not HRS)
6. **NREL2024** — Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Station Corridors (HRS-related, may be useful)
7. **Efthymiadou2025** — Optimization Approach for H₂ Infrastructure (general, not HRS)
8. **Odenweller2025** — Green Hydrogen Ambition and Implementation Gap (general H₂)
9. **Prokopou2025** — Cost Optimal Design of HRS (HRS-specific, may meet new criteria)
10. **Sujan2024** — Nationally Scalable Hydrogen Fueling Infrastructure (HRS logistics)

## What to Do With These

### Option 1: Use as Supplementary Sources
- If you find gaps in your 10 new HRS-specific papers
- Review these for additional context on specific topics
- Cite as "supplementary sources" in thesis introduction

### Option 2: Keep for Reference
- Don't cite them, but use for background understanding
- Delete after thesis completion if not needed

### Option 3: Delete Permanently
- If you're confident the 10 new papers will be sufficient
- Can always restore from git history if needed
