1. Executive Summary
The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance (ECH2A) brings together industry, public authorities, civil society and other stakeholders to support the large-scale deployment of clean hydrogen technologies by 2030. ECH2A identified, soon after its launch, the need for a robust and harmonised standardisation framework. That led to the creation of a dedicated Working Group (WG) on hydrogen standardisation in February 2022. This WG on Standardisation was tasked with the development of a standardisation roadmap and as a result it was able to:
· make a comprehensive analysis of ongoing hydrogen related standardisation activities; · establish a comprehensive overview of standardisation gaps/priorities and needs along the
whole value chain; · increase information exchange about and improve the awareness of, future and ongoing
standardisation activities; · streamline standardisation ideas emanating from different initiatives; · schedule topics in a timeline; Common European and international hydrogen standards are key to the successful roll out of hydrogen technologies and applications. Considering the complexity of the technologies as well as the time needed to develop standards representing the `State of the Art' (typically requiring a few years), a development plan with priorities for such standards should be established and be initiated as soon as possible. It is essential that standards are developed in a timely fashion ensuring alignment with the legal/regulatory framework and development of technologies.
Figure 1: Policy framework in relation to development of hydrogen technologies In the roadmap, more than 400 topics are listed and are "clustered" along the segments of the hydrogen value-chain. A simple visualisation tool is proposed to quickly identify the state of play of standardisation activities. Some segments are already well addressed (mentioned as "under development") such as gas cylinders and building-residential applications meaning that most of these standards should be in place soon. Whereas a few other segments such as industry (commercial/industrial/process heat) and mobility (aviation, maritime and heavy-duty and road vehicles) will require the development of new standards. Finally, the prioritisation work allowed to identify issues for which pre-normative research activities are needed; to name a few; safety aspects (e.g. material compatibility, leakage) or issues linked to different energy carriers.
5

Beyond the identification of individual standardisation topics, the WG on Standardisation identified in the roadmap a number of issues, namely complementary needs that are required to facilitate the implementation. The most important ones are the following:
a. A clear regulatory framework to give direction to the detailed standardisation work; b. The publication of standardisation requests, which are mandates of the European Commission
to prepare specific standards; c. The engagement of industry in topics that "need to be developed" and/or topics for which no
standardisation committees are exist or are yet active; furthermore, a good information exchange with associations such as Hydrogen Council, IPHE, IRENA, Hydrogen Europe and others is needed; d. The need for an overall coordination of hydrogen standardisation activities focusing on the technical needs of industry; the alignment with European Commission policies and legislation and the implementation capacity of CEN-CENELEC; e. Increased cooperation between European and international standardisation bodies based on the existing agreements (Vienna / Frankfurt agreement). Finally, the WG on Standardisation issued a set of key actions which should pave the way for new hydrogen standards to accelerate the roll out of large-scale hydrogen solutions. Key action 1: Integration of the identified standardisation topics list into the standard-setting process at EU level (CEN-CENELEC) and international level (ISO-IEC). Key action 2: Prioritise, as a first step approach, topics that are not yet directly addressed in specific standardisation committees; topics that need further technical understanding to allow for identification of standardisation needs; topics that are horizontal and therefore relevant for different segments of the hydrogen value chain. Key action 3: Get broader stakeholder engagement in the standardisation process by sending experts to the relevant standardisation committees. Key action 4: Call on the European Commission to support the hydrogen standardisation process by issuing standardisation request(s). Key action 5: Continuous support of the standardisation process by the WG on Standardisation. Key action 6: Strengthen the coordination of the overall process, including with relevant Horizon Europe Partnerships.
Disclaimer
This roadmap reflects the work of the Working Group on Standardisation on Hydrogen set-up in the context of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance. The list of standardisation issues and priorities identified do not necessarily represent the position of individual members of the Alliance.

2. Introduction 2.1 General
The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance (ECH2A) supports the large-scale deployment of clean hydrogen technologies by 2030 by bringing together renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production, transport, storage, demand in industry, mobility and other sectors. It aims to promote investments and stimulate the roll-out of clean hydrogen production and use.
Set up in July 2020, the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance is part of the EU's efforts to ensure industrial leadership and accelerate the decarbonization of industry in line with its climate change objectives. Its members come from industry, public authorities, civil society and other stakeholders.
The creation of the ECH2A is one of the measures foreseen by the European Industrial Strategy and the EU Hydrogen Strategy to support the emergence of a European hydrogen economy. The targets of the Hydrogen Strategy have been more recently strengthened by FitFor551 and REPowerEU2, which, among several other measures, attribute to renewable hydrogen an important role in diversifying gas supplies and in reducing the dependence on fossil fuels, and the energy dependence from Russia. To achieve these goals, REPowerEU proposes a Hydrogen Accelerator to double the previous EU target to 20 million tons of hydrogen production and imports by 2030 and to enable the development of a hydrogen-compatible infrastructure.
This European policy framework for hydrogen aims at a massive deployment of hydrogen technologies and systems in the EU in the coming years spanning the required manufacturing capacities, supply chains and dedicated infrastructures. One of the enablers for this transformation of the industrial and energy system is the availability of a robust and harmonised standardisation framework. Technical work for this transformation has been ongoing for several years, producing European and international standards which have facilitated the development of research and innovation and demonstration and pilot projects. However, this standardisation process was not designed in view of the current projected acceleration to large-scale deployment. The production, transport, storage and use of hydrogen ten or hundred fold quantities greater than those available today calls for the adaptation and improvement of the existing standardisation framework notably for industrial productions and usage. Regarding specifically the safety dimension, it is also paramount to guarantee safe solutions to increase the market and users' confidence in the uptake of hydrogen technologies. Coherent and shared safety principles and approaches need to be informed by new pre-normative research, to guarantee an acceptable safety level in the presence of greater volumes of hydrogen being deployed across society at large, and therefore affecting more directly the population.
In line with the new European standardisation strategy, this new fit-for-purpose standardisation framework should be developed for and in Europe strengthening European leadership in the various international standardisation bodies where standards and technical regulations are developed for world-wide applications.

The wide breadth and complexity of the hydrogen value chain and rich diversity of hydrogen applications imply a multitude of diverse standardisation needs. Standardisation already has started for many segments. This needs to be brought into a comprehensive overview. There is a clear need for better coordination and coherence of standardisation activities on hydrogen and a more strategic approach to this issue in order to achieve the EU policy objective to deploy hydrogen on a large scale in line with the Fitfor55, REPowerEU and industrial policy objectives. The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance published a report3 back in October 2021, identifying the lack of hydrogen standards as an important barrier to the roll out of hydrogen technologies and applications. Consequently, it established a dedicated Working Group on hydrogen standardisation.
Note:
When joining the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, NGOs issued a declaration stating that they (i) agree to engage and contribute to the deployment of renewable hydrogen in terms of supply, demand and distribution as this promotes the rapid phase-out of the use and production of all fossil fuels in order to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement.; (ii) thus do not consider fossil fuel based hydrogen as a short- or long-term solution; and (iii) contribute to targeting the use of renewable hydrogen specifically to those sectors and industrial processes which are hard to decarbonise (steel, cement and basic chemicals, aviation, shipping and heavy good vehicles).
2.2 ECH2A WG on Standardisation ­ Tasks and expectations
The main objective of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance Working Group (WG) on Standardisation is to contribute to the better coordination, coherence and guidance of hydrogen standardisation activities and in line with the EU Strategy on Standardisation4, to call for a more strategic approach to this issue in order to achieve the policy objective to deploy hydrogen on a large scale in line with our Fitfor55, RePowerEU and industrial policy. The WG on Standardisation has been tasked to:
1. identify issues, gaps, challenges and priorities for the existing standardisation framework along the entire value chain,
2. develop a roadmap. It is not the goal of the WG to design or develop standards. This is the mandate of the European standardisation bodies CEN, CENELEC, and/or of their international counterparts ISO or IEC. The WG on Standardisation has been formed based via a call of expression of interest open to all members of the ECH2A. It is composed of 44 members, most of which are experts involved in standardisation committees at national, European and international levels who are very knowledgeable on standardisation processes and projects. The WG on Standardisation has been

complemented with representatives of CEN and CENELEC and representatives of National Standardisation Bodies. The list of experts and observers is provided in Annex I. Thanks to the involvement of CEN and CENELEC representatives it has been possible to also take into account:
· ongoing work in the CEN and CENELEC Technical Committees; · work from the CEN-CENELEC Sector Forum Energy Management and Transition / WG
Hydrogen; · the potential draft hydrogen standardisation request (initiated by DG ENER); · the standardisation request on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive (AFID), drafted by
DG MOVE; · ongoing international standardisation activities; · sector specific activities for future standardisation, e.g. maritime. Thus, the work of the WG on Standardisation also builds on the previous work done by CEN-CENELEC (see in particular cross-references in the standardisation list Annex II). The WG on Standardisation organised itself in six subgroups, composed of 8-12 members, reflecting the structure of the Alliance and its roundtables. One additional subgroup was established to address cross-cutting issues. The subgroups were tasked to: · identify standardisation topics; · describe standardisation gaps/needs; · identify challenges along the entire value chain; · specify the relevant segments' specific regulatory and standardisation framework. The roadmap has been written via continuous exchanges between all the members of the WG on Standardisation. The ECH2A Roundtables provided additional input and commented on the draft list of identified standardisation topics to ensure that the entire hydrogen value-chain is covered.

3. Scope of the roadmap
This roadmap covers standardisation needs for the entire hydrogen value chain, from production, distribution, transport and storage to end-use applications (Figure 3). It considers hydrogen as an energy carrier available in the following forms:
· liquid hydrogen · gaseous hydrogen
o pure (100% H2) o hydrogen-natural gas (H2NG), H2 blends · others: · Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) · Liquid Inorganic Hydrogen Carrier (LIHC) · ammonia (NH3) · methanol (CH3OH) · OxyHydrogen (HHO)
Figure 3: Schematic representation of the complex hydrogen value chain It was agreed at the start of the process that the roadmap would not discriminate between different forms of hydrogen. Therefore, "clean hydrogen" means renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and is simply referred to as hydrogen in this document. It is also not the intention of the roadmap to discriminate between different hydrogen production pathways. The roadmap represents the collective view of the members of the WG on Standardisation. It does not represent the views of the European Commission nor its services that facilitate the work of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance.

4. Standardisation
4.1 Aim of Standards
A standard is a technical document designed to be used as a rule, guideline or definition. It is a consensus-built, repeatable way of doing something. Standards are created by bringing together all interested parties such as manufacturers, consumers and regulators of a particular material, product, process or service who agree on common specifications and/or procedures that respond to the needs of business, meet consumer expectations and guarantee acceptable levels of public safety. Standards are part of the knowledge economy that underpins European industry and society. They facilitate innovation and promote the adoption of new technologies. Standardisation bodies operate at national, regional or international level.
Figure 4 ­ Coherence of standardisation and innovation advantages
4.2 Explanation of the European standardisation process and timelines
European Standardisation is a key instrument for the consolidation of the Single Market and for strengthening the competitiveness of European companies, thereby creating the conditions for economic growth. European Standards are a valuable tool for facilitating cross-border trade ­ both within Europe's single market and also with the rest of the world. They reduce unnecessary costs for both suppliers and purchasers of products and services ­ in the public and private sectors. Standards ensure interoperability and safety, reduce costs and facilitate companies' integration in the value chain and trade. They complement European and national policies and make it easier for companies and other actors to respect relevant legislation. The European Standardisation System is unique in the world and strictly respects the founding principles defined by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the field of standardisation, namely coherence, transparency, openness, consensus, voluntary application, independence from special interests and efficiency.
Thanks to the work and involvement of an impressive number of experts nominated by CEN and CENELEC Members, as well as experts representing societal stakeholders (consumer organisations, environmental organisations, trade unions), SMEs and all relevant stakeholders (e.g. business and industry associations, public authorities, trade associations , etc.), European standardisation deliverables are market-driven and take into account the public interest as well as the concerns and priorities of society at large. An essential required characteristic of a European Standard is that it results from consensus of all parties participating in the drafting of standardisation deliverables.
11

Although technically anyone can propose work that will result in a European Standard, at CEN and CENELEC the work is usually channeled by their members (the CEN National Standardisation Bodies and the CENELEC National Committees). If enough CEN and/or CENELEC members are willing to be involved in the development process, the work is then assigned to a CEN and/or CENELEC Technical Committee (TC) in the field concerned. At the same time, `standstill' is enforced on all national work surrounding the same topic. Once the Technical Committee is established, mirror committees of stakeholders at national level decide on the national contributions regarding the development of the standard. In addition to the CEN and/or CENELEC members, Technical Committees also include a number of observers, such as ISO/IEC members, the European Commission/EFTA, European partners including Annex I organisations, external European industry associations and other affiliate bodies. Indeed, only by including all relevant stakeholders can CEN and CENELEC deliver standards fit for purpose: not only reflecting `State of the Art' technical requirements but also take into account digital, social/environmental/societal challenges.
Once the proposal for a standard has been evaluated and approved, the proposal goes on to the drafting stage which is based on consensus-building. When the draft standard is finalised, it goes up to public enquiry open to all interested parties. When the enquiry is over, the votes and comments on the standard are evaluated and depending on the result, the draft standard is either published or additionally worked upon and subsequently submitted to formal vote. This process lasts, on average for 2,5 - 3 years (see details on the dedicated CEN and CENELEC webpages).
Once published, European Standards shall be implemented by the CEN and CENELEC Members, with the obligation to withdraw any national standard that would conflict with the European Standard. Hence, one European Standard becomes the national standard in all 34 Member countries of CEN and CENELEC, ensuring a common level of quality, safety, security and sustainability. This guarantees that a manufacturer has easier access to the market of all the member countries when applying European Standards and this also applies whether the manufacturer is based in a member's territory or not.
4.3 Global standardisation activities
Most global standardisation activities are performed by ISO (the International Standardisation Organisation) and by IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission).
Both organisations are working according to the same principles and similar procedures than CEN and CENELEC. Through their members from approximately 170 countries, they bring together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant International Standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.
Examples of hydrogen standardisation by ISO and IEC are provided in Annex VIII.
European standardisation bodies in an international context
The European standardisation bodies are part of a dynamic ecosystem, a global standardisation community that is constantly evolving in response to the ever-changing needs of our societies, a fastmoving global economy and the rapid rate of technological innovation. CEN and CENELEC have dedicated agreements with the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), promoting the benefits of European Standards to international trade and markets harmonisation. The high level of convergence between European and international standards is facilitated by the ongoing technical cooperation between CEN and ISO (Vienna Agreement) and between CENELEC and IEC (Frankfurt Agreement).
The main objectives of these agreements are to provide a:
12

· framework for the optimal use of resources and expertise available for standardisation work; · mechanism for information exchange between international and European Standardisation
Organisations (ESOs) to increase the transparency of ongoing work at international and European levels.
In the frame of their long-standing technical cooperation agreements with ISO (Vienna Agreement) and IEC (Frankfurt Agreement) CEN and CENELEC continuously encourage the alignment of European Standards to international ones. This agreement facilitates the development of ISO and IEC standards to support European legislative and policy needs and are valuable tools for the promotion, dissemination and implementation of ISO and IEC Standards in Europe. These agreements avoid the duplication of work and structures, thus allow expertise to be focused and used in an efficient way to the benefit of international standardisation.
CEN and CENELEC are fully engaged in joining forces with all willing actors to look for international solutions: CEN and CENELEC have a tradition of supporting the primacy of international standards by ISO and IEC thus ensuring a global level playing field.
Other global entities
For some sectors, specific global entities are setting requirements that need to be mentioned even if standards cannot refer to these due to their principally voluntary character. To name a few:
For Maritime IMO, the International Maritime Organisation, is the specialist United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution by ships. (see Annex V)
For Mobility, UNECE The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe plays a role. As a multilateral platform, UNECE facilitates greater economic integration and cooperation among its member countries and promotes sustainable development and economic prosperity. UNECE provides so called Global Technical Regulations to facilitate international cooperation within and outside the region. For example, GTR No 13 on Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles and GTR N 110 for CNG in vehicles.5
UNIDO, the United Nation Industrial Development Organization supports countries to industrialise in ways that foster digital and green transitions and accelerate progress with the Sustainable Development Goals. One of the main objectives is to support sustainable supply chains by setting global environmental and social standards, alongside knowledge and technology transfer to improve quality and add value.
4.4 Hydrogen standardisation landscape
Several European and international standardisation committees are responsible for hydrogen standardisation topics along the entire hydrogen value chain. Figure 5 shows a graphic summary of these Technical Committees at European and international level and their relationship. The figure represents currently known Technical Committees involved with hydrogen topics. Further Technical Committees are to be expected over time to tackle additional hydrogen standardisation aspects. The graph highlights the complexity and the large number of actors involved in the hydrogen standardisation process.

Note: The titles of the named standardisation committees in Figure 5 are provided in Annex III. Further details about certain international standardisation committees (e.g. ISO/TC 197 and IEC/TC 105) are given in Annex VIII.
4.5 Activities related to hydrogen standardisation in other organisations
Similar or related analysis and prioritisation work is being performed by industrial, governmental and international associations and bodies, such as the Hydrogen Council, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE), the Clean Hydrogen Ministerial (HEM) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).
For example, since decades, the IEA dedicates specific attention to hydrogen and fuel cell topics in its two Technical Collaboration Programmes (TCP): Hydrogen and Advanced Fuel Cells which run various tasks dedicated to hydrogen safety and to other regulation, codes and standards (RCS) topics.
14

Annex IV provides information on the activities related to RCS (regulation, codes and standards) and information regarding other organisations.
Many standardisation issues require aligned approaches at global level such as trade aspects (definition of clean hydrogen and certification) and transport of hydrogen (maritime, etc.) that need international interoperability and consensus. For this, there is a need to strengthen the cooperation between inter-governmental bodies and standardisation bodies such as ISO and IEC, to identify early enough in the process issues that would preferably be addressed at international level. For example, hydrogen trade is a matter of governmental policies and international agreements and implies the adoption of a common certification system for low-GHG emissions hydrogen.
4.6 Pre-normative research
Pre-normative research (PNR) is an essential step for advancing regulations, codes, and standards. PNR activities aim at providing sound scientific and technological facts to either fill the existing gaps in RCS or progress beyond the knowledge available at that point in time, supporting the development of RCS.
Over the last years, several initiatives and instruments at the EU level have been focused on identifying the needs for PNR activities on fuel cells and hydrogen technologies and addressing the needs for R&I and coordination actions to support the development of RCS.
The following are the major European funding tools for PNR:
· the Clean Hydrogen Partnership (see Annex VI) and its precursor, the Fuel cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking have played and will continue to play a major role in setting a PNR strategy and funding PNR projects
· other European funding schemes of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme for research complement the contribution of the Clean Hydrogen Partnership
· the Metrology partnership (EURAMET, see Annex VII) · the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency
CEN and CENELEC internal PNR initiatives (sector specific)
4.7 Regulatory and standardisation framework
A European hydrogen standardisation framework has obviously to align to the European policies enshrined by the general EU legislative framework related to climate law and the Green Deal, and further embedded in the more technical regulatory framework aiming to decarbonise specific sectors (industry, mobility and transport, etc.).
Regarding the overarching EU climate and energy policies, the following non-exhaustive pieces of legislation can be mentioned:
· European Climate Law6

Each section in Chapter 6 is dedicated to a specific hydrogen end-use application or supply-chain element and provides a more complete list of the European Regulations to be considered for the specific standardisation needs.
Finally, the general objectives of the EU standardisation regulation 1025/2012 and the new (2022) European Standardisation strategy apply also to the hydrogen standardisation process.
Madrid Forum Conclusions (11th May 2022)
The Forum underlines the importance of defining quality standards for hydrogen and supports the Commission to mandate CEN and CENELEC to develop standards for the quality of hydrogen in the hydrogen network and at end-users with the involvement of all relevant market participants.
The Forum stresses the importance of enabling the cost-efficient integration of renewable and low carbon gases in the existing gas system. It is key to ensure that these gases have full access to wholesale and retail markets, infrastructure and cross-border trade.
5. Methodology at the basis of the roadmap
5.1 Identification of the standardisation topics
The basis of the roadmap are standardisation topics identified and collected by:
· the members of the WG on Standardisation subgroups · CEN - CENELEC representatives
o CEN-CENELEC list (incl. SFEM reports) o CEN-CENELEC SFEM WG H2 Workshops (background, approach + SFEM WG WS)
A list of approximately 400 standardisation topics were gathered. See Annex II.
The list includes a description of:
· the standardisation topics and gaps, identified by surveying the WG on Standardisation members and observers
· the relevance for 100% H2 and / or H2NG · the status of the standardisation project:
o in place: standard published; Hydrogen standardisation topic is already covered o under revision: an existing standard will be revised to address the hydrogen
standardisation topic o in preparation: standardisation topic is addressed; preliminary project; new project o to be identified: no standardisation project nor committee is identified · the responsible standardisation committee
In addition, a matching with the existing CEN-CENELEC draft work programme, elaborated in the context of the potential hydrogen standardisation request and further identified topics by CEN CENELEC, was done in order to visualise which standardisation topic is already addressed by CENCENELEC and which are additionally identified by the WG on Standardisation. This gives a comprehensive picture of all topics and facilitates the overall implementation.
The number of mentioned topics reflects the wide scope and the diversity of standardisation topics. This list represents a snapshot of standardisation knowledge of the involved parties at the time of elaboration. Further topics will be identified over time.
17

The analysis of the identified topics has led to:
· a topic clustering and timelines based on the identified standardisation needs of the WG subgroups (6.2 to 6.8),
· a prioritisation (6.9), · the identification of complementary needs (6.10).
5.2 State of development and timeline
This roadmap presumes that a coherent and appropriate set of standards is in place by 2030. A typical time frame for the development of a single standard is 2-3 years.
Based on the state of their standardisation the topics in the clusters were classified as (see 6.2 to 6.8.):
· under development: the main topic is already identified as a project or in a technical committee
· to be developed: for the main topic no project and/or technical committee was identified · PNR: Pre-normative research topics · in place: if the standards for the main topic are already published
Clear milestones have to be defined by CEN, CENELEC, ISO or IEC in line with the prioritisation.
6. Results of clustering, prioritisation and complementary needs
6.1 General
This chapter presents the results of the analysis described in the previous chapter.
The matter has been organised around hydrogen applications and/or supply chain segments, here called clusters:
· hydrogen production · hydrogen infrastructure (transport, storage, delivery) - transmission and distribution (T&D) · industrial applications · mobility · energy - sector integration including the power generation sector · building - residential applications · cross-cutting
In each of these clusters, the matter has been further grouped into `topics'. Each cluster section provides a short introduction on the technologies/sectors involved, the reference to the specific regulatory framework (RCS ­ regulations, codes and standards) and finally a list of technical needs and their timeline.
The prioritisation was carried out from an over-arching view to identify horizontal topics and related synergies and interdependencies for standardisation. Thus, it does not follow the cluster structure.
As standardisation is not a stand-alone action, complementary needs are identified that significantly support the standardisation action.
18

6.2 Cluster: Hydrogen production
6.2.1 RCS Framework
The hydrogen value chain begins with the first stage: production. Here different technologies, pathways' (water electrolysis, fossil or biological resources via SMR/ ATR, biomass, biomethane, and waste) and input resources (power, water, fuels, electricity, waste, biomass, biomethane, others) establish the energy vector hydrogen. Due to the anticipated international trade, hydrogen and its carriers ­ as a significant pillar for decarbonisation and as a substitute for more polluting energy sources ­ requires a global common standardisation system to avoid market fragmentation or barriers to cross-border trade.
The production stage includes the purification and compression and possibly storage at the production site. From the production stage other value chain steps are relevant and need to be considered as well, such as hydrogen transportation, distribution, storage, transformation or end-uses.
Legal and regulatory framework18
The basis for this transition will be developed mainly via the FitFor55 package and the Hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package but also with other regulations mentioned in section 4.7 above.
A series of legal, regulatory and standardised procedures and certifications are essential to enable production facilities and equipment along the process and to ensure that the hydrogen produced meets pre-established quality and emission requirements, including quantitative definitions of lowcarbon and renewable hydrogen, a robust methodology for and accounting rules for the GHG-emission of the produced hydrogen (see cross-cutting aspects in section 6.8 below)
Standardisation framework
The European and international levels are the main sources of standardisation for hydrogen production. For the further development of European standards, it is important that the potential draft hydrogen standardisation request that has been in preparation between CEN and DG Energy is updated and that additional requests be published as needed.
6.2.2 Technical needs and timeline
The relevant technical committees are already in place and developing and updating the relevant standards for hydrogen production. Emphasis is on clean and alternative hydrogen production below defined emission thresholds.
Depending on the regulatory frame that still needs to be completed, besides electrolysis, other lowcarbon production paths may exist, this might even include negative emission technologies.19 Along with industry best practice, harmonised standards will be needed to ramp up production and ensure technology leadership of European engineering technologies.
Electricity grid connections, Power to X technologies, as well as gas quality aspects are crucial parts to standardise such as to facilitate hydrogen production. Taking into account material compatibility to ensure safety, will also be needed and shall be developed from PNR activities to feed international standards.

6.3 Cluster: Infrastructure ­ Transmission and Distribution T&D
Infrastructure in the context of this study describes the grid from the injection facility up to the inlet connection of gas appliances. This includes injection, transmission, distribution, storage, compression, pressure regulation and measuring, installation, as well as related requirements on safety, gas quality, environment, emissions and management systems.
Gas infrastructure conveys gases (e.g. natural gas and biomethane) to residential, commercial and industrial end-users. It is technically possible to repurpose the existing natural gas infrastructure for the storage and conveyance of hydrogen and its blends from the production to the end-use with a limited extent of adaptations.
6.3.1 RCS Framework
Legal and regulatory framework
The existing infrastructure builds an essential and economic solution to convey hydrogen to the applications, such as industry, using hydrogen as combustion fuel and/or feedstock. It facilitates the transition from fossil natural gas to hydrogen and other low- and decarbonized gases and its blends. Thus, the repurposing and possibly extension of the infrastructure builds a basic element of the takeup of hydrogen market.
The repurposing of the infrastructure for hydrogen is a major contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy system.
For gas infrastructure and its repurposing the legislation in section 4.7 above applies. The following are of specific significance:
· Gas directive for the common European market · Proposal for a Regulation on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure amending
Regulations (EC) No 715/2009, (EU) 2019/942 and (EU) 2019/943 and Directives 2009/73/EC and (EU) 2019/944, and repealing Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 · The new Gas Directive proposal: Proposal for a Directive on common rules for the internal markets in renewable and natural gases and hydrogen (revision of Directive (EU) 2019/692 amending Directive 2009/73/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas), COM/2021/803 final, especially:
o Article 19 (Cross-border coordination on gas quality) o Article 20 (Hydrogen blends at interconnection points between Union Member States
in the natural gas system)
20

· A Gas Regulation proposal: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the internal markets for renewable and natural gases and for hydrogen (recast) COM/2021/804 final (revision of Regulation (EC) No 715/2009)
· Gas Network Codes for interoperability and data exchange (NC INT) ­ including gas quality aspects
Standardisation framework
The European standards for on-shore gas infrastructure are mainly elaborated at CEN level, whilst the standards for off-shore infrastructure are taken-over from international standards.
Standardisation of the gas infrastructure is composed by functional standardisation for design, construction, operation and maintenance and by standardisation of the necessary equipment (e.g. valves, meters, pressure regulators, safety devices, ...).
For the repurposing and extension of the existing infrastructure, an update of these European and international standards is needed to include specific requirements on adaptation measures (choice of material, sealings, safety aspects) and also assessment criteria to make the infrastructure fit for purpose for hydrogen and to ensure its safety, operation and maintenance. This includes the provision of appropriate hydrogen quality standards to ensure the safe conveyance and use of hydrogen and its blends at end-use.
The revisions are well underway in the responsible CEN-CENELEC and ISO Technical Committees (e.g. CEN/TC 234, CEN/TC 69, CEN/TC 235, CEN/TC 236, CEN/TC 237, CEN-CLC/JTC 6; ISO/TC 67 SC 2, CEN/TC 12, ISO/TC 197) for 100% of hydrogen and blends. Examples are the CEN/TS 17977 for hydrogen used in repurposed natural gas systems and also the inclusion of hydrogen concentrations in the existing Hgas quality standard EN 16726.
The standardisation work is coordinated by bilateral liaisons and also by exchange in the CEN Sector Fora20 on Gas infrastructure and Gas utilization.
The following standardisation requests are driving the present European standardisation of gas infrastructure and might need revision when the current draft legislation (see section 4.7 above) will be adopted:
· M/017 Standardisation mandate to CEN in the field of equipment and installation for the transmission and distribution of gas (Equ.& inst.-trans.& distr.-gas) EEC (PPD_93_38) Procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors
· M/71 Mandate to CEN for standardisation in the field of Pressure equipment (2014/68/EU (PED_2014) - Pressure equipment (in revision)
· M/400 Gas quality - further standardisation request on H2 quality announced at Madrid Forum 05/2022
· M/475 Mandate to CEN for standards for biomethane for use in transport and injection in natural gas pipelines
· M/441 Measuring instruments for the development of an open architecture for utility meters involving communication protocols enabling interoperability
20 A CEN or CEN-CENELEC Sector Forum builds an integral long-term interface amongst a number of Technical Committees of a sector and relevant CEN partners. It deals with common problems, the monitoring of progress of a work program and presenting CEN proposals for new fields of activities within the sector and across sectors, as well as taking initiatives to avoid duplication of work.
21

· M/533 for alternative fuels infrastructure in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, to draft European standards
Further standardisation requests might be relevant for some specific aspects of infrastructure. Furthermore, the coherence of the standards for infrastructure between the connection from production to application would be much supported by a dedicated EC standardisation request to CENCENELEC as it would give a comprehensive basis for coordination of all related standardisation activities.21 6.3.2 Technical needs and timeline Based on the similarities and differences between methane (natural gas) and hydrogen, the impact of hydrogen on the gas infrastructure needs to be considered for adaptations of the infrastructure. This should also be accounted for in the revision of the gas infrastructure standards needed to cover the repurposing of existing and the building of new gas grids to ensure suitability of the existing infrastructure or H2 and its blends with natural gas and biomethane. Practically, new infrastructure for natural gas, currently in construction as a response to the energy crisis, is built to be operated also with hydrogen at a later stage. These infrastructures are so-called hydrogen-ready. The extent and timeframe for revisions and new elaborations differ for each of the aspects and some aspects also rely on further research results. As an example - from the technical perspective ­ about 80% of the requirements in existing functional system standards for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas infrastructure are also applicable for hydrogen, e.g. depending on the component (e.g. transmission pipelines > 16 bar; compressor stations). For other areas, research is on-going (see below).
Figure 7: Cluster Infrastructure ­ current status of standardisation
21 The process for a potential EC standardisation request to CEN-CENELEC started already in 2016. A draft document and possible first work programme is available. With the further development of the EC hydrogen strategy, the Fit for 55 and RepowerEU initiatives and finally also with the ECHA work on a standardisation roadmap, the process on the potential EC standardisation request has not been completed yet and will need a new set-up.
22

The following aspects need specific attention for 100% H2 and blends:
· materials (steel, plastics, elastomers, sealings) and related effects (embrittlement, fracture mechanics, permeation, leakages etc.)
· safety aspects of hydrogen/ explosion prevention and protection (ATEX, detection, odorization etc.)
· interoperability within the technical system, including injection · gas quality
o hydrogen quality from repurposed grids o hydrogen quality from different production technologies o alignment of hydrogen quality standards between all stakeholders (all relevant CEN-
CENELEC/ISO-IEC TCs involving producers, pipeline operators, end-users, technology providers such as LOHC.) · volume in relation to energy content · gas (underground) storage (CEN applied for an EISMEA project for PNR on the suitability of steel casings and tubings) · definition of hydrogen terminals/hydrogen infrastructure o Standards needed for the handling of hydrogen and derivatives when using hydrogen terminals and injecting into the hydrogen grid to avoid issues at interconnection points. o The definition of hydrogen infrastructure in the "Hydrogen Package" and other regulations/directives should secure technological neutrality for all technologies. Thus, LOHC and other forms of carriers, to import hydrogen, should be able to access the hydrogen system.
In the revision and drafting process, existing (industry) documents (ASME, EIGA), national standards and/or codes of practice are used where technically appropriate (see repurposing above). Also this is valid for findings from European (technical) associations, such as Marcogaz22 (infrastructure + gas quality aspects, EASEE-gas23 (gas quality aspects), EU Prime Movers Group24 and others.
6.4 Cluster: Industrial application 6.4.1 RCS Framework
The potential foreseen for hydrogen in the decarbonisation of industrial sectors relates to the different roles of the gas:
· hydrogen as a feedstock (i.e. a chemical, a raw material) for industrial processes · hydrogen as a combustion fuel for industrial heating and process heat
Examples of the first role are the production of renewable ammonia by using renewable hydrogen, and the decarbonisation of the steel industry by using renewable or low-carbon hydrogen in alternative ore reduction processes, replacing natural gas.
For the second role, renewable or low-carbon hydrogen can replace the hydrocarbon fuels used traditionally in combustion aiming to produce heat or steam used in commercial and industrial processes, or used as process heat for the production of e.g. glass.
22 MARCOGAZ ­ Hydrogen quality for blending with NG ­ Technical recommendations, published June 2022 23 EASSE gas ­ Hydrogen Quality Specification, published February 2022 24 Prime Movers Group (PMG) - Decarbonizing The Gas Value Chain, CHALLENGES, SOLUTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS, published January 2022
23

In this section the two roles are considered separately in order to address their specific standardisation needs.
Legal and standardisation framework - feedstock
The following high-level regulations and the cited in section 4.7 cover the valorisation of renewable hydrogen and are supporting the development and implementation of technical measures for the decarbonisation of industrial processes:
· European Emission Trade System 2018/410 (ETS) · The `Green Taxonomy' Regulation 2020/852 · Industrial Emission Directive 2010/75/EU (IED) · Proposal for a Regulation establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism COM(2021) 564
(CBAM)
These Commission legislative proposals are still under trilogue discussions. They also depend on the fixation of a methodology for the measure of the `carbon level' of the hydrogen used (see section cross-cutting topics).
For chemical processes, analytical and control equipment and possibly separation equipment (e.g. membrane technology and/or pressure swing adsorption) will be required to keep the chemical processes under a stable operation and possibly to use the hydrogen. An additional burden in global competition is the cost of installing and operating this equipment. As separation processes always require energy, the installation of equipment to keep the chemical value chain running is a matter of debate in relation to other EU policies such as the EED and ETS, or financial aid.
Legal and standardisation framework - heating
The decarbonisation of the industrial heat sector is a challenge, due to the scarce availability of lowcarbon alternatives and therefore of high priority. There is a wide range of applications from commercial heat applications through to industrial process heat applications which require high amounts of energy and where hydrogen is seen as the alternative, renewable fuel for this subsector.
The basis for this transition will be developed together with the following regulations and those mentioned in section 4.7. above:
· Gas Appliance Regulation 2016/426/EU (GAR); · Medium Combustion Plant Directive EU 2015/2193 (MCPD)25; · Industrial Emission Directive 2010/75/EU (IED)26; · Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC27 · Pressure Equipment Directive 2014/68/EU · Ecodesign Regulation EU/813 & 814/201328
25 DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2193 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 November 2015 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium combustion plants 26 DIRECTIVE 2010/75/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) 27 DIRECTIVE 2006/42/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC 28 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 814/2013 of 2 August 2013 implementing Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to ecodesign requirements for water heaters and hot water storage tanks
24

Standardisation in the industrial heat sector is focused on the European level (e.g. CEN/TC 131, CEN/TC 186, CEN/TC 58) with the aim of fulfilling the essential requirements of the named European regulations. For the further development of the European standards, it is important that the current draft standardisation request on the Gas Appliances Regulation and the potential draft request on hydrogen will be published as soon as possible. Standardisation on the international level is done independently but with the aim of transferring as many technical aspects as possible that are defined at European level to international standards. According to industry, gas quality fluctuations caused by the use of hydrogen can be technically managed, but there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution and individual assessments will be required as applications and processes will be optimized for the typical (historical) natural gas quality at the exit. For sensitive equipment and raw material processes a CEN proposal foresees the Wobbe index variation limit of 3,7 MJ/m3 (at reference condition of 15°C/15°C). Solution complexity depends on the specific application, installed equipment and expected hydrogen or by-product content. Installations and industrial processes switching from natural gas to hydrogen may involve very high CAPEX which need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 6.4.2 Technical needs and timeline
Figure 8: Cluster industry ­ current status of standardisation
It is of high priority to update existing standards for the design and test of the application for the use of H2 blends29 (e.g. materials, safety, performance, emissions, leakages, product testing, ...) and 100% H2 in the long-run. Therefore, it is important to define gas qualities in advance to adopt specific burner designs. The hydrogen gas quality / impurities have a huge impact on e.g. the Wobbe Index and therefore on the combustion process, efficiency and emissions. These potential influences need to be evaluated and tested in pre-normative studies/lab tests. Note: A joint Task Force of the CEN-CENELEC Sector Fora for Gas infrastructure, Gas utilization and Energy management WG Hydrogen is investigating the hydrogen quality needs of industrial end-uses,
29 Blends up to 20 % H2 are currently basis of the considerations in the CEN Technical Committees, whilst some stakeholder does not share the view on the use of hydrogen blends.
25

looking also into the impact of trace components and impurities and also into possible technical mitigation solutions.
Additional technical adaptations like specific sensors or material aspects have also to be considered. Specific field tests with various applications are needed in addition for the adopted burners.
In parallel it is important to update the existing European Standards for the use of 100% H2 and H2 blends to prepare the basis for certified burners. Therefore, harmonised test conditions need to be defined and validated under lab conditions.
For the feedstock subsector it was only possible to identify a few topics in the timeframe of preparing this roadmap. In order to develop a detailed work programme further work will be needed.
6.5 Cluster: Mobility
The mobility sector in this roadmap includes the following modalities:
· road vehicles · heavy-duty on and off-road vehicles · railways · maritime vessels · aviation
6.5.1 RCS Framework
6.5.1.1 Legal and regulatory framework

Annex V contains a more detailed overview of all the legal and regulatory framework for maritime related topics.
Legal and regulatory framework specific - railways
The general European regulatory framework for the authorization of rolling stock is based on the Directive on the Interoperability of the Rail System within the EU 2016/797 and the Directive on Railway Safety 2016/798. The use of hydrogen propulsion systems in the railway domain is managed through:
· The Rolling Stock - Locomotive and Passenger Technical Specification for Interoperability, established in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Interoperability Directive and specifically its Article 10 on innovative solutions,
· The Common Safety Methods, established in accordance with Article 6 of the Railway Safety Directive.
Legal and regulatory framework specific - aviation
· Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU Aviation proposal)
6.5.1.2 Standardisation framework
This section describes the standardisation framework. For railways, maritime vessels and aviation specific additional aspects are referred to separately.
Existing general standardisation requests for mobility are:
· M/533 - Standardisation request addressed to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI in support of the implementation of the Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure
· M/581 - Standardisation request to the European standardisation organisations as regards communication exchange, electricity and hydrogen supply for road, maritime transport and inland navigation in support of Directive 2014/94/EU and its planned revision under the `FitFor55 package.
Standardisation framework specific - railways
European actors are leading international standardisation activities at CEN, CENELEC, ISO and IEC in the relevant railway committees (CEN/TC 256, CLC/TC 9X, ISO/TC 269 and IEC/TC 9), with the aim to provide a mature and proven in use input for future EU regulation. Regarding the on-board hydrogen propulsion subsystem, work is proceeding at the ISO and IEC level through the IEC 63341 series:
· Part 1 for fuel cells, · Part 2 for compressed hydrogen storage systems, · Part 3 for fuel cell testing.
All these documents are developed in active liaison/ cooperation between IEC/TC 9, IEC/TC 105 and ISO/TC 197 and benefit from the strong involvement of European experts through CLC/TC 9X as this project is a parallel development under Frankfurt Agreement.
27

Regarding the infrastructure subsystem, work is taking place within ISO/TC 269. Standardisation framework specific - maritime and inland shipping For the maritime sector, vessels are regulated by IMO ­ The International Maritime Organisation. Further information on the contents and relations are given in Annex V. For inland shipping the relevant standardisation body is not IMO but the European Committee for the Development of Standards in the Field of Inland Navigation (CESNI). It was created in June 2015 by the CCNR at the request of the European Commission. It brings together all the Member States of the European Union as well as Switzerland, to draw up unified standards applicable both on the Rhine and on the other waterways of the Union, in the field of technical prescriptions, professional qualifications and information technology. Also, there is CEN/TC 15 in charge of inland navigation vessels. In the framework of M/580, CEN/TC 268 is in charge of developing two standards for inland vessels:
· A European standard containing technical specifications with a unified solution for compressed (gaseous) hydrogen refuelling points and bunkering for maritime and inland waterway hydrogen-fuelled vessels
· A European standard containing technical specifications with a unified solution for liquefied hydrogen refuelling points and bunkering for maritime and inland waterway hydrogen-fuelled vessels
Standardisation framework specific - aviation The standardisation work on this specific sector is just starting. Hydrogen for aviation decarbonisation has recently been brought to the attention of International Civil Aviation Organisation ICAO and one of the challenges identified is to develop dedicated standards regarding hydrogen for aviation in particular issues related to the safety framework (leakage, firefighting, safe handling of cryogenic H2, ...). Initial initiatives have been launched (see Annex V). 6.5.2 Technical needs and timeline General technical need and timeline - mobility The following Figure 9 shows the main topics to be considered in the standardisation process on mobility. Due to the complexity of the mobility segment the given topics are generic and further details are given in the standardisation list (Annex II) and in the paragraphs below.
28

Figure 9: Cluster mobility ­ current status of standardisation
Technical need and timeline - road and rail transport
In the framework of M/533, CEN/TC 268 developed three standards for road vehicles:
· EN 17127:2020 `Outdoor hydrogen refueling points dispensing gaseous hydrogen and incorporating filling protocols'
· EN ISO 17268:2020 `Gaseous hydrogen land vehicle refueling connection devices (ISO 17268:2020)
· EN 17124:2022 `Hydrogen fuel - Product specification and quality assurance - Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell applications for road vehicles'
Also, in the framework of the standardisation request M/581, CEN/TC 268 is entrusted with developing two standards for heavy duty vehicles:
· A European standard containing technical specifications with a unified solution for hydrogen refueling points dispensing compressed (gaseous) hydrogen for heavy duty vehicles
· A European standard containing technical specifications with a unified solution for hydrogen refueling points dispensing liquefied hydrogen for heavy duty vehicles
The development of (international) standards for vehicle on-board hydrogen storage (350 bar, 500 bar, 700 bar, liquid, LOHC) and the safe integration of on-board H2 storage and hydrogen propulsion systems and refueling infrastructure & processes will be necessary in road and rail transport to provide the necessary framework. In the railway domain, the main challenge is to adapt the regulatory framework for the authorization of rolling stock to trains with a hydrogen propulsion subsystem. However, this requires a complete, mature and proven in use normative referential, which is now being drafted (see above) and the adaptation of other relevant norms that did not consider this type of propulsion technology (e.g Fire & Smoke).
It is only once this normative framework is fully available, that the sector will be able to propose the relevant modification of the European regulatory framework for train authorization. It is expected that a first set of complete norms should be available by 2025 and updated on the basis of project return of experience by 2028. Prescriptive Regulatory changes before the availability of such a mature
29

normative framework would be counterproductive. Progress on the standardisation of hydrogen refueling infrastructure for all mobility applications is also important to de-risk investments and reduce costs. Standardisation of hydrogen refueling systems' design and interface and of the building norms for certifying HRS should be envisaged for a European widespread network to develop.
Technical need and timeline - maritime
A comprehensive standardisation approach for different propulsion systems in shipping is crucial to meet decarbonisation targets. This includes providing norms for the deployment of all promising technologies. Vessels with propulsion systems using LOHC as a H2 fuel carrier will be rolled out for use in the second half of the 2020s, as such the requisite standardised framework is a high priority.
A secure regulatory underpinning for liquid carriers such as LOHC will also be vital to provide certainty for hydrogen imports.
In the framework of the standardisation request M/580, CEN/TC 268 is entrusted with the development of two standards for maritime (and inland) vessels:
· A European standard containing technical specifications with a unified solution for compressed (gaseous) hydrogen refueling points and bunkering for maritime and inland waterway hydrogen-fueled vessels
· A European standard containing technical specifications with a unified solution for liquefied hydrogen refueling points and bunkering for maritime and inland waterway hydrogen-fueled vessels
The following aspects need specific attention to enable a fast realisation of LOHC/fuel cell powertrains:
· Development of (international) standards for vessel on-board hydrogen storage (350 bar, 500 bar, 700 bar, liquid e.g. LOHC) o Standards for new ship fuel types that will be required to achieve Fit for 55 goals are needed. It is essential to start work on regulating for future zero-emission ships to encourage first movers. The first on-ship fuel cell powertrains with an on-board liquid organic hydrogen carrier release units are in development.
· Safe integration of on-board H2 storage and hydrogen propulsion systems o Standards will be needed to provide a framework for the safe integration of on-board H2 storage and propulsion systems where hydrogen or its derivatives (e.g. LOHC) are used including on board hydrogen generation from hydrogen derivatives (e.g. dehydrogenation of liquids such as LOHC).
· Integration of high-temperature applications in vessels o Provide a framework for the integration of high-temperature applications (e.g. dehydrogenation, high-temperature fuel cells and on-board fuel cell waste heat usage) in inland and maritime vessels
· Refueling points and bunkering o LOHC / liquid hydrogen derivative refueling points and bunkering for maritime and inland waterway vessels ­ ISO 8217 "Petroleum Products ­ Fuel (class F)" applies to LOHC
· LOHC as an alternative fuel/fuel carrier o The maritime on-board usage of LOHC as a hydrogen fuel carrier
· Safety issues for maritime transport, storage and use
30

o Guidelines for the use of hydrogen in its gaseous and liquid forms as well as its storage in either of these or other forms (hydrides). LOHC needs to be added to ISO/TR 15916:2015 "Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems)
· Transport and storage: o Lack of standards for marine bulk storage of hydrogen carriers (e.g. LOHC) covering both existing and new terminals. This includes conversion services (liquefaction, (de)hydrogenation, purification, etc.). Such standards will become increasingly important to handle the envisaged future H2 imports. o Standards are needed for the transport of renewable hydrogen via hydrogen carriers (e.g. LOHC) for different transport pathways offshore, onshore and for inland hubs (road, rail, shipping). o Multi-modal transport will be needed to ensure optimal geographical coverage of hydrogen supply.
Technical need and timeline - aviation
Standardisation mapping will need to be further refined, as stakeholders from this segment did not come forward to participate in the WG on Standardisation. From a legislative perspective it is recommended, in conjunction with the standardisation mapping, to look into an AFI for aviation, notably in the context of the future EU Regulation on Clean Aviation.
6.6 Cluster: Energy ­ Sector integration including power generation sector
The energy system integration sector includes activities to facilitate
· the take-up and use of hydrogen in power and combined heat (CHP) and power generation and
· flexibility of the grid.
It also addresses hydrogen storage and distribution of hydrogen networks as well as local grid and heat distribution networks that reach out to local off-takers allowing for generating units to maximize their efficiency and load factors.
Regarding power generation, existing turbines must be assessed on an individual basis as they have been constructed to specific requirements agreed between operators and technology suppliers. For the majority of engine power plants, only minor modifications will be necessary to allow for the use of up to 25% by volume of H2 - depending on the base gas. In many cases it will be possible to upgrade the plant for use with 100% by volume H2. Today's newly constructed power stations are usually operated with natural gas but can be designed and built to be H2 ready. A paper providing a definition for H2-ready engines was published by EUGINE in September 202130. Depending on the percentage of hydrogen that the engine can handle three different "H2-Ready categories" are listed
· H2-Readiness Level A: 100% vol. hydrogen · H2-Readiness Level B: up to 25% vol. hydrogen blended into natural gas · H2-Readiness Level C: up to 10% vol. hydrogen blended into natural gas
Note: This cluster `sector integration' is named `energy' in the list with identified topics in Annex II.

6.6.1 RCS Framework Legal and regulatory framework Hydrogen brings many opportunities for the decarbonization of the energy sector as highlighted in the Communication "Powering a climate-neutral economy: An EU Strategy for Energy System Integration"31. This issue was brought forward in the FitFor55 package and the Hydrogen and decarbonised gas market package. The integration of the variable electricity generation sources expected in the short-medium term will also require deployment of resources providing flexibility to the energy system. Together with energy storage solutions, gas turbines (power generation) are also key assets for balancing the electricity system. There is a policy need to better assess how (both as a fuel and a produced output) clean hydrogen shall be introduced over time in power plants and CHP systems of differing forms based, for example on a methodology in delivering the required decarbonised residual load. Standardisation framework The process of developing standards in this field is only starting. It requires much more research and innovation activities. Most standards still need to be developed and a lot of attention will have to be paid to safety aspects. Together with the specific topics related to the energy conversion system, the overall concept of energy infrastructure must also be considered. 6.6.2 Technical needs and timeline
Figure 10: Cluster sector integration ­ current status of standardisation For the sector integration, it was only possible to identify a few topics in the timeframe of preparing this roadmap. In order to develop a detailed work programme further work will be needed.
6.7 Cluster: Building ­ Residential application
Gas heating appliances (i.e. condensing boilers, micro-CHP including fuel cells, gas and hybrid heat pumps) will need to continue to play an important role, complementing the electrification of heating. In order to fully decarbonise the gas-based heating sector, a significant increase in the use of green gases, whether biomethane or hydrogen, in both pure and blended form, is needed. 6.7.1 RCS Framework Legal and regulatory framework Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumed and 36% of energy-related direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Most of the emissions are from the existing building stock, which
31 Powering a climate-neutral economy: An EU Strategy for Energy System Integration, COM(2020) 299 final.
32

would require deep renovation to reduce CO2 emissions. It is of high priority to increase the renovation rate (EU renovation wave) of the building stock but also to replace fossil fuels by renewable gases such as hydrogen in addition to electrification.
The basis for this transition will be developed from the RSC defined in the FitFor55 package and the Hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package. The following regulatory texts are of specific importance:
· Energy Performance of Buildings Directive32 · Gas appliance regulation 2016/426/EU · Regulation on Ecodesign (EU) 813 & 814/201333 and Energy labelling (EU) 811 & 812/201334,
where the current preliminary study for regulation update suggests the introduction of H2 ready devices working with 20% H2 blends and 100% hydrogen.
There is an urgent need to develop and certify appliances (boilers, hybrids, thermally-driven heat pumps, micro-CHP, etc.) which are able to run with alternative renewable gases such as hydrogen.
Standardisation framework
Standardisation in the residential heating sector is mainly carried out at the European level. Most standards are harmonized with the Gas Appliances Directive.
It is important to ensure that European standards continue to develop and that:
· the draft standardisation request for Gas Appliance Regulation is finalised and published · the potential standardisation request for hydrogen will be finalised and published.35
The process of updating the standards to make all heating appliances "100% vol. H2 ready", enabling them to cope with the various fluctuations in the methane/hydrogen mix, is well underway and is expected to be fully completed by the end of this decade. In this area, several technical committees are currently working on the necessary standardisation requirements for hydrogen. Meanwhile, currently installed appliances cannot be re-certified or re-classified in general for hydrogen use due to certification rules. As a result, a country-by-country / case-by-case approach is being applied, to ensure that installed appliances are compatible when hydrogen blending is introduced into networks.
32 DIRECTIVE 2010/31/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings 33 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 813/2013 of 2 August 2013 implementing Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to ecodesign requirements for space heaters and combination heaters 34 COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 812/2013 of 18 February 2013 supplementing Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the energy labelling of water heaters, hot water storage tanks and packages of water heater and solar device 35 The process for a potential EC standardisation request to CEN-CENELEC started already in 2016. A draft document and possible first work programme is available. With the further development of the EC hydrogen strategy, the Fit for 55 and RepowerEU initiatives and finally also with the ECHA work on a standardisation roadmap, the process on the potential EC standardisation request has not been completed yet and will need a new set-up.
33

6.7.2 Technical needs and timeline The relevant CEN Technical Committees are already elaborating and updating the relevant standards for hydrogen use in buildings. The focus is on pure hydrogen and for a transition period for blending with natural gas respectively biomethane.
Figure 11: Cluster building ­ current status of standardisation It is of high priority to update existing standards for the design and testing of applications using 100% hydrogen and H2 blends regarding e.g. materials, safety, performance, emissions, leakage, product testing, etc.. Therefore, common test conditions have to be aligned with the relevant European regulations. Additional experts have to be involved in the process and lab testing for the validation of the standardised test conditions are needed especially for 100% H2. Furthermore, it is important that all relevant technical standardisation committees dealing with products and appliances used in buildings are involved to speed up this standardisation process. As a basis for design developments, it is important to define and guarantee properly the gas quality distributed in the pipelines locally/regionally and the related gas quality information communicated to end-users (e.g. Wobbe Index). 36
6.8 Cluster: Cross-cutting
Within the scope of this cross-cutting section are topics that apply to a wider range of aspects of the value chain. These range from energy carriers, sustainability criteria and guarantees of origin of hydrogen, metrology and analysis, as well as general safety aspects. Cross-cutting includes the topics that are relevant for different parts of the hydrogen value chain, including global trade as a commodity. For the development of hydrogen trading in particular, certification is an essential element of any transaction. Certification of hydrogen and its derivatives would include information on compliance with standards and regulatory requirements and would be verifiable against data on sustainability criteria such as environmental footprint and renewable energy usage data. This would enable hydrogen and derivatives to be differentiated from other, more polluting fuels and gases. The cross-cutting issues for standardisation are:
36 Prime Movers Group (PMG) - Decarbonizing The Gas Value Chain, CHALLENGES, SOLUTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS, published January 2022
34

· energy/hydrogen carriers · sustainability and origin of hydrogen, including Live-cycle-analysis (LCA) and Performance
Energy Factors (PEF) · (voluntary) carbon credits · approaches to guarantee public safety for new hydrogen applications and systems (safety
aspects) · metrology (see Annex VII) · chains of custody: guarantees of origin, mass balance systems, book and claim systems · training of personnel/education
6.8.1 RCS Framework Sustainability aspects and hydrogen valorisation
In May 2022, the European Commission consulted on two proposed delegated acts clarifying EU rules applicable to renewable hydrogen under the 2018 Renewable Energy Directive. The first proposal covers renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and sets the criteria for products that fall under the `renewable hydrogen' category.
The second proposal puts forward a detailed scheme to calculate the life-cycle emissions of renewable hydrogen and recycled carbon fuels to meet the greenhouse gas emission reduction threshold set in the Renewable Energy Directive. Both are still under trialogue discussions.
In addition to these two delegated acts, the Gas Directive ­ currently in revision ­ aims at defining lowcarbon hydrogen, gases and fuels based on life-cycle climate impacts. A delegated act will clarify EU rules applicable to these energy carriers.
The 2018 Renewable Energy Directive called to expand the system of Guarantees of Origin to other energy carriers, including hydrogen, while the proposal for revised Gas Directive refers to mass balance systems as chain of custody systems for low-carbon hydrogen, gases and fuels.
Public safety
While industrial safety has been optimised along more than a century of hydrogen uses in chemical and petrochemical processes, the development of a global hydrogen economy requires deployment of hydrogen systems in areas of society where they have never been till now. This will probably imply the movement of hydrogen quantity at many orders of magnitude higher than the level currently transported.
The European regulatory framework already in place is able to cover, for example with the ATEX and the PED directives and the related set of harmonised standards, the present needs. The work ongoing at the international standardisation bodies ISO and IEC is also translating the general safety principles and rules into hydrogen-specific requirements. However, the framework already in place must be broadened and adapted to the new hydrogen applications. This effort must occur in parallel with the improvements of general approaches and methodologies, in particular in the areas of risk assessment, and mitigation, and risk-informed design.
35

6.8.2 Technical needs and timeline
Figure 12: Cluster cross-cutting ­ current status of standardisation Both, the domestic production and the import of hydrogen will be based on multiple modes and technologies. The import of (renewable) hydrogen will play a role in the future. Hydrogen can be liquified or bound to molecules that are easier to transport in liquid form (e.g. LOHC, HydroSil, KBH4,and others). To enable the realisation of these options, it is important to establish standards for all viable modes of transport. Furthermore, because of the need for a diversified hydrogen infrastructure, standards should ensure coverage of all technologies. Technical standards related to the quality, storage and handling of hydrogen carriers (e.g. LOHC, HydroSil, KBH4, and others) will be needed to ensure reliable operation of plants and certainty along the entire value chain. It is crucial that sensing technologies provide reliable and comparable results when use to measure and meter chemical and physical properties of hydrogen (such as quality and quantity, temperature and pressure, etc.). To achieve this important need these technologies and systems have to be calibrated with metrological references to ensure traceability and proper validation in documentary standards. Measurement solutions for quality assurance and assessment, leak detection, energy content, storage or flow metering of hydrogen in gaseous or liquified form and in hydrogen carriers (e.g. LOHC), are not metrologically validated and standardised yet and therefore cannot be widely adopted in the hydrogen value chain. Moreover, a new, standardised and harmonised methodology is needed to calculate the GHG footprint of hydrogen systems along their entire value chain. In combination with a set of robust and hydrogenspecific sustainability criteria, this methodology will allow for the assessment of the sustainability of the hydrogen produced domestically or imported. Credible systems to determine and certify the sustainability criteria of the produced and imported hydrogen and derivates are paramount. In the supply chains, hydrogen and derivates from different sources and technologies might be mixed. Yet, consumers willing to pay a premium for renewable hydrogen must be given reliable information about the actual nature of the hydrogen or derivative delivered, which requires the development of credible chain of custody systems, such as mass balance systems or guarantees of origin.
36

Similarly, to PNR activities, there will be a need to ensure a communication channel between the work of the WG on Standardisation, CEN-CENELEC and the Metrology Partnership
6.9 Prioritisation
To enable a functioning hydrogen market requires in the end that all systems, processes, equipment and applications are ready to be operated with hydrogen. Prioritisation here means giving a specific focus on aspects that need more intensive attention and action to facilitate either the initiation of standardisation processes or to develop requested contents, without neglecting standardisation that is already on a good track.
Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that ­ due to the manifold parallel working technical standardisation committees - several standardisation topics can be treated in parallel by the experts.
The list of identified standardisation topics (see Annex II) shows that in some parts of the value chain topics are already well addressed and are advanced in the standardisation process; their publication could be expected within the next two - three years. For other parts there are standardisation topics that have been identified but not yet in process or that have not been allocated to CEN-CENELEC/ ISOIEC Technical Committees or for which information in the WG on Standardisation is not yet mature.
The analysis of the standardisation list showed that it is important to introduce a prioritisation of standardisation activities in order to better coordinate/ streamline the standardisation activities. Under this context the following three aspects should be treated under high priority:
1. Horizontal aspects: topics on which other topics depend 2. Topics to be developed: topics where no project and/or relevant Technical Committee were
identified 3. Pre-normative research topics: topics that need more knowledge prior to standardisation
Horizontal aspects:
Some topics are indicated by several WG subgroups (see Annex II). This emphasises their horizontal relevance for different sectors.
Their processing should be given a higher priority due to the fact that other standardisation projects depend on their finalisation. The following Table 1 summarizes these horizontal aspects and their details. It is not considered exhaustive.

Topic to be developed
Identified standardisation topics which were not able to be assigned to an existing project or standardisation committee are highlighted in the standardisation list in Annex II and should also be dealt with as a priority. Additional efforts are needed to get e.g. all the stakeholders involved and find consensus on how the standardisation of these topics could commence as soon as possible.
Examples are standards for different hydrogen carriers such as Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) or refueling stations. Here additional efforts are needed to identify and/or establish the relevant standardisation committees, get experts involved within them and start the work on standardisation as soon as possible.
Pre-normative research topics
Pre-normative research efforts were also highlighted in the standardisation list set out in Annex II as needing to be given enhanced priority, since they build an important bridge between innovations and early standardisation needs.
An example would be material compatibility studies to assess the impact of hydrogen on components or piping.
Fortunately, in many areas these studies are already ongoing as set out in the roadmap's summary of ongoing pre-normative research projects.
For examples on pre-normative research partnerships, reference is made to Annexes VI and VII.
6.10 Complementary needs
The individual standardisation topics would require complementary actions to facilitate their implementation. The most important ones are the following:
a) A clear regulatory framework to give direction to the detailed standardisation work: 38

The boundaries for the production and use of hydrogen need to be legally stipulated to enable the standardisation community to define the proper aspects in their standards (e.g., gas quality issue - in which modes of blending will be allowed ­ what will appliances need to be manufactured for)
b) The publication of standardisation requests, which are mandates of the European Commission (EC) to prepare specific standards:
The cooperation between EC and CEN-CENELEC needs to be further streamlined and speededup to achieve a coherent set of standardisation requests for all parts of the hydrogen chain, including the review of existing draft standardisation requests and the establishment of additional requests.
c) The engagement of industry especially in those topics that "need to be developed":
Especially for the topics for which no standardisation committees exist or are active, stakeholders (e.g. ECH2A members, European associations, consumer organisations) need to pro-actively involve themselves in the standardisation bodies or CEN standardisation liaisons or partners.
For some topics the standardisation committees are already active, nevertheless additional expertise should support the efficiency of the standards' drafting process.
The limited level of technical detail in this document shows that further input of stakeholder, including members of the European Clean HYdrogen Alliance, is needed to come to the full picture.
Furthermore, enhanced information exchange with associations such as the Hydrogen Council, Hydrogen Europe and other organisations is needed.
d) The need for an overall coordination of H2 standardisation activities focusing on the technical needs of industry, coordination on pre-normative research (PNR) with Horizon Europe Partnerships and the alignment with EC policies and legislation and the implementation capacity of CEN-CENELEC:
With a view to the actual transition and technical dimension it is crucial to bring the needs, knowledge and policies of all parties together to come efficiently to a coherent set of standards at reasonable terms.
e) Increased cooperation between European and international standardisation bodies based on the existing agreements (Vienna / Frankfurt agreement):
Aligned standards at global scale are supporting the global and economic ramp-up of hydrogen technologies. From the European perspective, active involvement by European parties including leadership in the European and international standardisation processes are crucial to satisfy the EC policies and European industries' expectations.
7. Implementation
For the ramp-up of the European hydrogen economy it is essential that standards are available for the European stakeholders in time and that these standards are in line with the targets set by the European decarbonisation agenda.
39

Figure 13 ­ Achievements of the WG on Standardisation
This roadmap gives a comprehensive overview on ongoing and missing standardisation topics along the whole hydrogen value chain, sets priorities, puts the topics in a timeline and clusters the main aspects of the specific hydrogen segments.
The list of collected standardisation topics (see Annex II) is not exhaustive. The topics mentioned represent a snapshot of standardisation knowledge of the WG on Standardisation members and CENCENELEC standardisation representatives at the time of elaboration; further topics will certainly be identified over time.
Next to the standardisation topics additional complementary needs are highlighted in this roadmap, which are essential for streamlining the standardisation process. An effective and time optimized implementation of hydrogen standards is essential and can only be achieved:
· through appropriate resources · through good coordination · and through the involvement of the relevant stakeholders.
As consequence of the investigations, the WG on Standardisation comes to the following key actions:
Key action 1: Integration of the standardisation topics list into the standard-setting process at EU level (CEN-CENELEC) and international level (ISO-IEC)
The ECH2A roadmap should be integrated into the work programme of the relevant standardisation bodies at CEN-CENELEC.
At CEN-CENELEC in co-operation with the national standardisation bodies, further analysis, prioritisation and resource allocation to the corresponding existing or new standardisation committees should be carried out. The overall process should be efficiently coordinated at CEN -CENELEC level, in co-operation with ISO and IEC (under respectively the Vienna and Frankfurt Agreements), to achieve a coherent set of standards and to avoid duplicative or contradictory work.
Whilst acknowledging the status of the national standardisation bodies (being members with voting rights) and CEN and CENELEC (cooperation partners) towards ISO and IEC, an efficient communication and information sharing procedure also needs to be established to enhance overall cooperation.
40

Key action 2: Prioritisation
To enable the hydrogen take-up, finally standards are necessary for the entire value chain. Prioritisation, in a first step, needs to ensure that all topics are actively dealt with in standardisation. Therefore, prioritisation here is targeted to streamline the standardisation activities.
Specific focus should be put on areas where:
· topics are not yet directly addressed in specific Technical committees · topics need further technical understanding and identification of standardisation needs · topics are horizontal and therefore relevant for different segments of the hydrogen value chain · topics need additional pre-normative research activities
The final schedule of implementation should be determined by CEN-CENELEC based on the upcoming EC legislation and with help of the specific expertise in the dedicated technical committees depending on the
· availabilities of technical knowledge · availabilities of technical committees
It is acknowledged that many topics could be standardised in parallel due to committee structure in CEN-CENELEC.
Key action 3: Stakeholder engagement in the standardisation process
A broader stakeholder engagement is essential for the development of standards. Therefore, the WG on Standardisation requests the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance members and further stakeholders to better commit and verify/ensure their representation and input of expertise into the standardisation process. For SMEs and start-ups this task can be done via industrial associations.
Similarly, it is key that the European Commission, the European Standardisation Organisations and their national members, the National Standardisation Bodies, effectively facilitate participation of societal stakeholders (environmental, consumer and employee organisations) and SMEs in the drafting of the relevant standardisation deliverables as indicated in the Standardisation Regulation 1025/2012 and EU Strategy on Standardisation.
This Roadmap can be used to inform stakeholders about the ongoing standardisation projects and facilitate their exchange with the National Standardisation Bodies for involvement.
Key action 4: Call on the European Commission to support the hydrogen standardisation process
The WG on Standardisation calls on the European Commission to support the standardisation process by:
· reflecting these needs in the EC Annual Union Work Programme for European standardisation (AUWP);
· issuing one or more standardisation requests covering the whole supply and value chain; · providing funding for standardisation, its coordination and especially pre-normative research
in the segments of the value chain that are at the beginning of the process but also in those sectors for which standardisation is already ongoing; · providing clarification together with CEN-CENELEC on harmonised terminologies in legal and normative documents (e.g. low carbon hydrogen).
41

The European Commission should make best efforts to ensure that the necessary policy framework and legal requirements are put in place for the standardisation deliverables to underpin their implementation. Key action 5: Continuous support of the standardisation process The WG on Standardisation should continuously monitor and support the ongoing standardisation process in order to:
· create awareness and transparency of the ongoing standardisation in the ECH2A Forum; · identify further needs of pre-normative research and standardisation topics and
communicating to the standardisation bodies; · motivate ECH2A members to actively participate (encouraging nominations via National
Standardisation Bodies) in technical standardisation committees; · inform ECH2A members about the progress of standardisation; · update the Standardisation Roadmap on a regular basis.
Key action 6: Strengthen the coordination of the overall process, including relevant Horizon Europe Partnerships The WG on Standardisation considers Partnerships as the most efficient way to realize pre-normative research at European level. It strongly recommends to continue and possibly extend the cooperation between the Partnerships, the European Commission and the standardisation bodies:
· to use synergies to streamline the PNR activities and · make the research results available to the standardisation community.

Annex IV ­ Activities related to hydrogen standardisation in other organizations
Hydrogen Council
The Hydrogen Council, a global CEO-led initiative to advance the role for hydrogen in the energy transition globally, was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2017. It Comprises close to 145 multinational companies representing the entire hydrogen value chain. Using its global reach to promote collaboration between governments, industry and investors, the Council provides guidance on accelerating the deployment of hydrogen solutions around the world. The Hydrogen Council also serves as a resource for safety standards and an interlocutor for the investment community, while identifying opportunities for regulatory advocacy in key geographies. It recently performed a gap analysis and identified over 400 RCS gaps through desktop review, interviews and expert review. These gaps list was then refined within its members and led to 13 key gaps across 7 segments reported hereafter:
The RCS gaps covered mainly fall into safety performance and costs categories and apply to the production of hydrogen and its use for mobility. Worth to mention is that all gaps have been rated as highly critical and should be addressed within 2 to 3 years. Important to mention also is that these gaps have been mapped versus activities at ISO, IEC and other standardisation bodies. The progress status of the different RCS gaps is summarized on the figure below.
102

The progress status of the different RCS gaps is summarized on the figure above.
IPHE ­ International partnership for hydrogen and fuel cells in the economy
The IPHE is an international inter-governmental partnership. Its objective is to facilitate and accelerate the transition to clean and efficient energy and mobility systems using hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across applications and sectors. This partnership provides a forum for sharing information on initiatives, policies and technology status to accelerate the cost-effective transition to the use of hydrogen and fuel cells in the economy. IPHE Working Group on regulations, codes, standards and safety issued in 2021 a high-level gap analysis of regulatory areas for actions. This work aimed in first instance to inform governmental administration of the overarching challenges and priorities therefore it did not enter in the technical details provided by the work of the Hydrogen Council. A heat map of the critical areas identified by the IPHE is given in the picture below (red is considered most critical, orange is moderately critical, and yellow is less critical). Each of the main topics in grey in the table have been further handled in more details in other tables[1].
103

The results indicate that there are broad regulatory gaps for deployment of hydrogen technologies, particularly as the industry scales up and expands beyond road transportation. Critical areas of focus for regulatory improvements include the regulatory framework for inclusion of hydrogen in the natural gas system, both at the point of distribution and at the point of transmission. For hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, gaps exist primarily around scale-up and the use of liquid hydrogen, though these gaps lean primarily toward R&D needs. The most critical gaps for hydrogen mobility/transportation appear to be around acceptance of non-road transportation modes (rail, marine, aviation); feedback here and through the 2020 Research Priorities Workshop indicates a need for international collaboration, particularly where the IMO is concerned. More broadly, results of the survey determined that safety, including maintenance requirements, approvals, and inspections, is a priority and safety improvements should be incorporated into efforts to address the other gaps identified.

IRENA - International Renewable Energy Agency
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is a lead global intergovernmental agency for energy transformation that serves as the principal platform for international cooperation, supports
104

countries in their energy transitions, and provides state of the art data and analyses on technology, innovation, policy, finance and investment. IRENA drives the widespread adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy, including bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, solar and wind energy in the pursuit of sustainable development, energy access, and energy security, for economic and social resilience and prosperity and a climate-proof future. IRENA's membership comprises 167 countries and the EU. Together, they decide on the Agency's strategic direction and programmatic activities, in line with the global energy discourse and priorities to accelerate the deployment of renewables-based energy transitions worldwide. IRENA is implementing a project entitled "Quality Infrastructure (QI) for Green Hydrogen: technical standards and quality control for the production and trade of renewable hydrogen"[1] . The objective of the project is to develop a comprehensive roadmap for the development and implementation of the Quality Infrastructure services -standards, testing, certification, metrology- needed to scale-up a global green hydrogen production and trade. The project team for the past 4 months has been undertaking desk research on the existing quality infrastructure tools that are available for green hydrogen production and trade. The findings from this desk research will greatly inform the development a roadmap on the development of the quality infrastructure to overcome existing quality, sustainability, and safety challenges in green hydrogen production and trade ­ which is a key output of this project.

Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy - HD/M
-The Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy was published by the European Commission on 9th December 2020.EU transport greenhouse gas emissions will have to be cut by 90% by 2050. The Strategy lays out the European Commission roadmap to achieve these goals in the next ten years. With transport as a major end-use for hydrogen, the Strategy is therefore highly relevant for the hydrogen sector. -As part of the Fit-for-55 package, the Commission proposed a new regulation for maritime fuel. The FuelEU Maritime Regulation proposal is to stimulate fuel switching to alternative fuels. From January 2030, container ships and passenger ships at EU ports would also have to connect to onshore power supply and use it for all energy needs while at berth, with some exceptions. The proposed timetable sets a decrease of average carbon intensity by 2% in 2025, 6 % in 2030 and then further by 5-year periods till 2050. In 2050, the carbon intensity should be 75% compared to the 2020 base year. -For hydrogen refueling stations: 500 in 2025 and 1,000 in 2030, up from 144 currently. Whereas the need identified by the industry is larger, 1,500 HRS would be needed by 2030 for the heavy-duty sector, as stated by the industry, target-based rolling out of hydrogen refueling infrastructure across the TEN-E will help incentivise the switch to hydrogen mobility solutions and tackle the chicken-and-egg-problem.

Interactions between IMO and hydrogen:
1. IMO only covers vessels ­ anything that takes place onshore ­ i.e. bunkering, fuel storage in ports is OUTSIDE THE SCOPE of IMO mandate
2. IMO doesn't do any standards on hydrogen itself - fuel quality/purity is not within the scope of IMO activities.
111

3. IMO releases technical regulations for the design of hydrogen ships ­ both ships carrying hydrogen as cargo as well using hydrogen as fuel (both in ICE and FC).
4. Carriage of chemicals in bulk is covered by regulations in SOLAS (international regulations addressing safety of life at sea) and MARPOL (pollution prevention). Both Conventions require chemical tankers built after 1 July 1986 to comply with the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (IBC Code).
5. Other constraints come from variable ship operation profiles, trading routes, weather conditions, ship payload, layout, volume, weight requirements and - of course ­ cost ­ effectiveness. Under such complex conditions, Flag Administrations, which have the jurisdiction to approve vessels for operation, are reluctant or unable to accept novel disruptive technologies such as FC and H2 without the clarity of a solid marine regulatory prescriptive framework (Regulations, Rules, Code and Standards) at International (IMO) level.
6. For ships carrying hydrogen as cargo, the relevant piece of `guidelines' from IMO is the IGC Code (i.e.: International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk): a. The IGC Code currently does not specifically provide requirements for carriage of liquefied hydrogen in bulk by sea. b. This has been tacked by interim guidelines included in: "Recommendations for carriage of liquefied hydrogen in bulk" (see Resolution MSC.420(97) adopted on 25 November 2016). c. To mention that there is nothing for compressed hydrogen as cargo
7. For ships using hydrogen as fuel the key one is ­"IGF Code = International Code of safety for ships using gases and other low-flashpoint fuels". As hydrogen is a gaseous fuel, the general IGF code may apply. However, in the current version of this Code, regulations related to functional requirements are intended only for natural gas. It is nevertheless of utmost importance for the shipbuilding industry to have instruments for the use of other lowflashpoint fuels and Fuel Cells. The IGF Code provides general indications for a goal-oriented approach for the approval of such installations, to introduce novel technologies, designers and operators can only rely upon a performance-based technology qualification process, supplemented by complex safety assessment methodologies.
8. According to the IGF code, in the absence of specific normative provisions, the use of other low flash point fuels, including hydrogen, can be approved on the basis of an alternative design. This approach means that safety, reliability and dependability of the systems shall be proven equivalent to that achieved with traditional fuels and machineries.
9. Alternative design assessment is governed by the Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS II-1/55). Alternative design is the process by which the safety and reliability of systems must be demonstrated to be equivalent to that achieved by comparable new and conventional machines (main and auxiliary) that use fuel oils. It requires that extensive safety assessment methodologies (e.g. HAZID, risk assessments and explosion analyses) are carried out and that several functional requirements are fulfilled. Unfortunately the entire approval process is lengthy and costly, and relies on individual Flag State interpretations of the requirements.
10. There have been some recent developments in the right direction ­ as in September 2021 IMO has adopted "Interim Guidelines for the Safety of Ships using Fuel Cell Power Installations". However , this power installation does not cover the part of hydrogen storage This is a huge step forward for ships using fuels cells ­ H2 + ICE is still a problem though.
11. This is the extent of direct IMO activities related to hydrogen. Yet there are also several others indirect, including:
112

a. Recommendation on safety measures for existing vehicle carriers carrying motor vehicles with compressed hydrogen or natural gas in their tanks for their own propulsion as cargo (SOLAS regulation II-2/20-1)
b. Guidelines affecting other alternative fuels based on hydrogen ­ such as ammonia for example (e.g. standards on use of low-flashpoint fuels).
Standardisation projects in aviation: There are two standards developments on the use of hydrogen in aviation:
1. SAE AIR6464; EUROCAE/SAE WG80/AE-7AFC Hydrogen Fuel Cells Aircraft Fuel Cell Safety Guidelines, STANDARD by SAE International, 02/05/2020:
"The document defines the technical guidelines for the safe integration of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Systems (FCS), fuel (considered to be liquid and compressed hydrogen storage types only), fuel storage, fuel distribution and appropriate electrical systems into the aircraft. Note: Today PEM systems and fuel storage represent the most mature FCS technology and currently forms the basis for this standard. Other types of fuel cell systems and fuels (including reforming technologies and electrolyzes), may be covered by a further update to the document."
2. AS6858 "Installation of Fuel Cell Systems in Large Civil Aircraft", This is a joint SAE/EUROCAE development. The document will be released as both an SAE Aerospace Specification (AS) and a EUROCAE Minimum Aviation System Performance Standard (MASPS):
"This document defines the technical requirements for the safe integration of gaseous hydrogen fueled Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Systems (FCS) within the aircraft. Most of the technical concepts and approaches covered by this document represent current industry "best practice". Others require specific approval from the procuring activity before use. This requirement for approval is not intended to prohibit their use; but rather to ensure that the prime contractor has fully investigated their capability to perform reliably and to be sufficiently durable under the required conditions and that the prime contractor can present substantiating evidence for approval before the design is committed to."
113

Annex VI ­ Pre-normative research (PNR) activities in the Clean Hydrogen Partnership

The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertakings (FCH JU, FCH 2 JU37) have been supporting since 2008 the development of hydrogen-specific RCS through different activities. The JU has been supporting projects, through research grants, performing PNR activities along the hydrogen chain, from the hydrogen production to end-uses, covering also cross-cutting issues where needed (e.g., safety-related aspects). More than 24 project,s with a total cost of more than 64 million euros and a total EU contribution of more than 43 million euros, have encompassed both research activities and desk research activities in view of supporting RCS developments.

A special place is taken by project HYLAW, which has provided an analysis of the legal and administrative barriers blocking the widespread commercialisation of hydrogen technologies in Europe in general and in 18 EU member States, while recommending solutions to overcome the challenges.

Another relevant initiative has been conducted by the CERTIFHY project and follow up initiatives which have assessed the necessary market and regulatory conditions to develop the complete design and initiate a unique European framework for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen guarantees of origin.
Furthermore, the FCH 2 JU set up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Observatory (FCHO)38, an observatory that provides data (statistics, facts and analysis) and up to date information about the entire hydrogen sector, which includes a Policy & Incentives and Regulation, Codes and Standards module that provides users with a comprehensive overview of the most relevant policies, rules and standards that directly or indirectly affect the development and deployment of the hydrogen technologies covered by the FCHO.
The Clean Hydrogen Partnership or Clean Hydrogen JU39 is the successor of the FCH2 JU under Horizon Europe programme for research and innovation and will continue supporting projects performing PNR activities within its Horizontal area 1: Cross-cutting issues. Moreover, the CleanH2 will set up a Regulations, Codes and Standards Strategy Coordination (RCs SC) Task Force which will coordinate and monitor the strategy related to RCS within the JU Programme with the ultimate goal of increasing the EU impact in RCS development in Europe (and beyond), with the main focus but not limited to Standards.

The standardisation issues, gaps, challenges, and priorities along the entire hydrogen chain identified by the WG will, on many occasions, require pre-normative research activities. The need for R&I and coordination actions to support the development of RCS can be further developed by the CEN-CENELEC SFEM WG H2, as the long-term collaborative framework with major bodies for strengthening cooperation between regulatory work, which then will be addressed through the different EU instruments, also so-called implementing bodies, such as the Clean Hydrogen. Therefore, there will be a need to ensure a communication channel between the work of the WG, the CEN-CENELEC SFEM WG H2, and implementing bodies such as the Clean Hydrogen.

Annex VII ­ Pre-normative research (PNR) in the European Partnership on Metrology
The European Partnership on Metrology (the `Metrology Partnership')40, is an Institutionalised PublicPublic European Partnership as referred to in Article 10(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) 2021/695, jointly undertaken by Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Türkiye (the `Participating States'). The Metrology Partnership is managed by EURAMET, the European Regional Metrology Organisation and a non-profit association under German law. EURAMET also coordinates the European Metrology Networks with one of them focusing on 'Energy Gases' and in particular hydrogen. Standardisation framework EURAMET and The European Metrology Network for Energy Gases provide measurement science expertise to society and industry to support the implementation of the energy transition to renewable gaseous fuels. EURAMET identified priorities in hydrogen
The involvement of EURAMET's EMN Energy Gases on hydrogen standardisation is currently the following:
· Close cooperation between EURAMET and CEN-CENELEC (STAIR EMPIR platform): within the context of metrology research, STAIR (joint strategic Working Group to address
40 https://www.euramet.org/research-innovation/metrology-partnership)
116

Standardisation, Innovation and Research) co-operates with EURAMET by identifying metrology research needs with impact on standardisation · Normative calls under EMPIR (European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research) or the Metrology Partnership with topics focused on measurement methods, reference materials and metrological requirements.
Activities related to hydrogen include standardisation in the EMN for Energy Gases' Strategic Research Agenda:
· Participation in SFEM CEN-CENELEC WG Hydrogen workshops and brainstorms on standardisation needs ­
· Outcomes of metrology research projects are fed into appropriate CEN and ISO TCs dealing with hydrogen standardisation
· Recent contribution to Vocabulary of Hydrogen in Energy Systems (CEN/CLC JTC 6 and ISO TC 197)
Concrete examples of hydrogen-related projects funded within EURAMET's European Metrology Research Programs and the Metrology Partnership include:
Flow metering of renewable gases (biogas, biomethane, hydrogen, syngas and mixtures with natural gas) - Short Name: NEWGASMET.
Development of renewable energy sources is encouraged by the European Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC and by the European Green Deal. Renewable gases like biogas, biomethane, hydrogen or syngas can be used for this purpose. As they have characteristics that are slightly different from wellknown natural gas, the industry needs to study their impact on available flowmeters and to demonstrate their compliance with the Measuring Instruments Directive 2014/32/EU. The objective of the present project is to publish reliable data that is needed by the metrological and industrial community, and to provide recommendations on renewable gas measurement with adapted gas meter standards.
Metrology for Advanced Hydrogen Storage Solutions - Short Name: MefHySto.
This European project addresses the need of large-scale energy storage, which is required for a shift to renewable energy supply. Such storage is required to supply energy at peak times when renewable sources fluctuate. A possible solution for energy storage is large-scale use of hydrogen. Metrological traceability in the energy infrastructure for hydrogen storage is crucial. Thus, improved knowledge of chemical and physical properties of hydrogen as well as traceable measurements and validated techniques are imperative.
Metrology for hydrogen vehicles 2 - Short Name: MetroHyVe 2.
Current barriers to mass implementation of hydrogen in transport arise from European Directive 2014/94/EU and International organisation of legal metrology (OIML) recommendations that must be met by all European hydrogen refueling stations (HRS). This project will address these issues and will develop metrology that will enable hydrogen to become a conventional fuel and support the European energy transition. The project will tackle measurement challenges in hydrogen flow metering, hydrogen quality control and hydrogen sampling and fuel cell stack testing.
Metrology infrastructure for high-pressure gas and liquified hydrogen flows - Short Name: MetHyInfra.
117

This project is the first large-scale industry project that will provide the necessary metrological infrastructure (and traceability) required to address the measurement challenges that are currently faced by the hydrogen industry. This will support growth in several sectors (mobility, fuel cells, liquified hydrogen). The aim of this project is to ensure measurement traceability in the hydrogen distribution chain. Therefore, critical flow Venturi nozzles will be established as standards for use with high pressure gas and a traceability route for liquified hydrogen will be created. Without these measures, verifiable measurements are not possible, and hydrogen will not be accepted as an environmentally friendly fuel. Metrology for decarbonising the gas grid ­ Short name: Decarb The aim is to provide the primary standards, test facilities, validated methods and good practice that gas industry need to perform key measurements required to decarbonise the gas grid, including through 100% hydrogen and hydrogen enriched natural gas. Key measurements that the project focus on include flow metering, gas composition, physical properties and leak detection. Metrology for the hydrogen supply chain' ­ Short name: Met4H2. The aim of the project is to provide better standards for the safe application of hydrogen, flow measurement, hydrogen quality assessment and custody transfer. Together with outcomes from previous projects, an infrastructure will be established that provides measurement data that are fit for demonstrating compliance with regulations and contracts. These will help ramping up the use of hydrogen and society to adapt to using hydrogen instead of fossil fuels.
118

Annex VIII - Examples of hydrogen standardisation in ISO and IEC
ISO/TC 197 Hydrogen Technologies
One important ISO Technical committee on Hydrogen is ISO/TC 197 "Hydrogen Technologies". It is focused on standardisation in the field of systems and devices for the production, storage, transport, measurement and use of hydrogen.
Some relevant standardisation projects in this context are:
· ISO 22734: Hydrogen generators using water electrolysis -- Industrial, commercial, and residential applications. In particular, two new parts: o Part 1, on dynamic performance/ safety. o Part 2, on testing for grid service.
· ISO 19880: Gaseous hydrogen -- Fuelling stations. In particular, four new parts: o Part 5, update regarding dispenser hoses and hose assemblies. o Part 6, on fittings. o Part 7, concerning O-rings. o Part 9, on sampling.
· ISO 19885: Gaseous Hydrogen ­ Fuelling protocols for hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. In particular, three new parts: o Part 1, about general requirements. o Part 2, on communications. o Part 3, on high flow fuelling protocols for heavy duty road vehicles.
· ISO 19887: Gaseous Hydrogen -- Fuel system components for hydrogen fuelled vehicles. Besides, a Joint Working Group (JWG) has been set up with TC 22/ SC41.
· ISO/TR 15916: Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems. A revision is foreseen with regards to the (i) materials compatibility table, and (ii) a new chapter will be included on LH2 (as a result of FCH 2 JU Project PRELSHY).
A new Subcommittee has recently been created (ISO/TC 197/ SC1), focused on applications `requirements of hydrogen technologies at large scale and in horizontal energy systems, where:
· Hydrogen plays a central or significant role and where overlap or blending with other fuels and energy carriers and systems is considered.
· Different expertise and approaches are required due to different global technical regulations.
IEC/TC 105 Fuel cell technologies
One important IEC Technical committee (International Electrotechnical Committee) on Hydrogen is IEC/TC 105 ,,Fuel cell Technologies". It is focused on standards regarding fuel cell (FC) technologies for all FC types and various associated applications such as stationary FC power systems for distributed power generators and combined heat and power systems, FCs for transportation such as propulsion systems (see note below), range extenders, auxiliary power units, portable FC power systems, micro FC power systems, reverse operating FC power systems, and general electrochemical flow systems and processes. (except applications in the field of road vehicles which are coordinated by ISO TC 22 and its relevant SCs using the cooperation modes defined in the ISO/IEC Directives).
119

This TC is currently very active and 13 standards or projects are now under development. Besides, it is worth to mention that the "new" focus is on beyond road vehicles (on top of the classic performance testing methods):
· Safety of electrically powered industrial trucks · Fuel Cell Power Systems for unmanned aircraft systems - Performance test methods (drones) · Fuel cell and battery hybrid power pack systems performance test methods for excavators · Railway applications More information available on IEC Web-site: https://www.iec.ch/
