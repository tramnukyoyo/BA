# GOOGLE SCHOLAR TIPS & TECHNIQUES

## Basic Search Techniques

### 1. Exact Phrase Search
Use quotation marks to search for exact phrases:
- `"hydrogen refueling station"` (exact match only)
- `"levelized cost of hydrogen"` (exact match)

**When to use:** When you know the exact title or key phrase

### 2. Boolean Operators

**AND operator:**
- `hydrogen infrastructure AND corridors`
- Returns results with BOTH terms

**OR operator:**
- `hydrogen station OR refueling OR dispensing`
- Returns results with ANY of these terms

**NOT operator (minus sign):**
- `hydrogen infrastructure -aviation`
- Excludes aviation-related results
- `hydrogen refueling -fuel cell cars` (exclude FCV focus)

### 3. Wildcard Searches

Use asterisk (*) to match any word:
- `hydrogen * infrastructure` (matches: hydrogen AND [any word] AND infrastructure)
- `"hydrogen * cost"` (phrase with wildcard)

### 4. Author Search

Search for papers by specific authors:
- `"Krishna Reddi" hydrogen` (major NREL researcher)
- `"Jacobson" hydrogen infrastructure`
- `"Grubb" hydrogen policy`

### 5. Journal/Publication Search

Limit searches to specific journals or publishers:
- `site:sciencedirect.com hydrogen infrastructure`
- `site:springer.com hydrogen refueling`
- `"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy" hydrogen station`

### 6. Year/Date Filtering

In Google Scholar interface:
- Click "Any time" dropdown after searching
- Select "Last year", "Last 5 years", or set custom range
- Or include year in search: `hydrogen infrastructure 2024`

### 7. Citation Filtering

On Google Scholar result page:
- Click "Cited by X" to see papers that cite the current paper
- Click "View all versions" to find alternative sources (including open access)

---

## Advanced Search Strategies

### Finding Open Access Versions

If you hit a paywall:
1. Click "View all versions" on the Google Scholar result
2. Look for institutional repositories (e.g., Jülich, Fraunhofer)
3. Search ResearchGate: `site:researchgate.net "author name" "paper title"`
4. Email the author (many researchers will send free copies)

### Identifying Highly Cited Papers

On Google Scholar:
- Look for "Cited by X" numbers
- Papers with 50+ citations = well-established in field
- Papers with 10-50 citations = emerging important work
- Papers with <10 citations = very recent work

### Building on Found Papers

When you find a relevant paper:
1. Check its references (often gold mine of related papers)
2. Click "Cited by X" to find newer papers building on it
3. Look at author's other publications
4. Check related papers suggested by Google Scholar

## Search Workflow Example

**Goal:** Find papers on hydrogen refueling station costs

**Step 1 - Broad search:**
- Search: `hydrogen refueling station cost`
- Result: 50,000+ results (TOO MANY)

**Step 2 - Add specificity:**
- Search: `hydrogen refueling station cost analysis 2024`
- Result: 5,000+ results (still broad)

**Step 3 - Add component:**
- Search: `hydrogen compressor cost refueling station`
- Result: 1,000-2,000 results (manageable)

**Step 4 - Use phrase search:**
- Search: `"cost-optimal" "hydrogen refueling" compressor`
- Result: 100-500 results ✅ (good for detailed review)

**Step 5 - Filter by date:**
- In Google Scholar, click "Any time" → "Last 2 years"
- Result: ~50-100 recent papers (perfect for thesis)
