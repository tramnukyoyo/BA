Project Goal and Approach

Assess ranges of levelized cost of dispensed hydrogen to meet hydrogen fueling demand for transportation in the heavy-duty vehicle sector to
support development of hydrogen fueling corridors in the United States.

(1) System boundary and pathways
 Define system boundary  Define major
assumptions and inputs  Define pathways to
assess

(2) Run HDSAM and estimate costs
 Run HDSAM given inputs and assumptions
 Calculate costs by pathway and at the station component level

(3) Assess results
 What is the levelized cost contribution of each component?
 What is the production component?
 Understand where there is room for improvement

Remaining Challenges and Barriers
 Challenges are associated with obtaining data  high quality fueling station cost data to adequately model their deployment with station parameter changes
 Uncertainty of costs of hydrogen and electricity  Uncertainty of reliability and up-time of fueling stations
NREL | 13

Proposed Future Work: Considerations for HRS Parameters
There may be numerous HRS configurations depending on end-user requirements
 Incorporate latest learnings and cost data from newly built fueling stations to refine dispensed LCOH analysis. Parameters that may change could include direct capital costs, utilization rates, storage capacity, number of dispensers, refrigeration and cryogenic equipment, maintenance and operations costs, etc.
 Alignment on methodologies and assumptions with literature, academia, and industry.  Coordinate with other national labs or incorporate latest from hydrogen hubs to assess
potential national and/or regional adoption scenarios.

Note: Any proposed future work is subject to change based on funding levels

NREL | 14

Summary

 Dispensed LCOH for heavy-duty fueling stations can vary widely with utilization rates, station sizing, production costs, access to storage, delivery pathways, and hours of operation, for example.

 Economies of scale contribute to lowering costs at larger fueling station capacities; however, liquefaction remains a large cost component of the LH2 pathway.
 Current estimates for the 2030 timeframe range from as low as $3.80/kg to $11.70/kg [at 4 to 18 MTPD station capacities and 30%-80% utilization rates]

 This cost is not a retail price. Additional markup may be added depending on the retailer and supply/demand dynamics.

 Tax incentives were excluded from this analysis and could lower LCOH
