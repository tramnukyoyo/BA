**Year:** 2024
**DOI/Link:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.204

#### Quality Checks (Mandatory - all should be YES)
- [x] **Peer-reviewed?** ✅ YES — Int. J. Hydrogen Energy (top-tier journal)
- [x] **Recency:** ✅ YES — 2024 (recent)
- [x] **HRS-specific?** ⚠️ **PARTIAL/NO** — Title covers "production, storage, distribution AND refuelling" (TOO BROAD, not HRS-focused)
- [x] **Methodology clear?** ✅ YES — Likely clear
- [x] **Citation strength:** ❌ WEAK — Brand new 2024 (likely 0-2 citations). 263 citations
- [x] **Reference list depth:** ✅ LIKELY YES — Top-tier journal papers typically have 40-50+ citations
- [x] **Is this a review paper?** ⚠️ UNCLEAR — Appears to be comprehensive coverage but scope ambiguous

## Section 3: Search Execution Workflow

Follow this step-by-step process to systematically find and evaluate papers:

### Step 1: Initial Database Searches
1. **Open Google Scholar** (https://scholar.google.com/)
   - Most comprehensive, shows citation counts, date filters available
   - Best for broad overview of field

2. **For each of the 10 queries above:**
   - Copy the primary search term into Google Scholar
   - Apply date filter: "Since 2019" (or "2019-2025" if possible)
   - Sort by relevance
   - Skim first 20-30 results for promising papers

3. **Record promising papers:**
   - Note title, authors, year, journal, citation count
   - Save PDF if easily available
   - Add to `PAPER_CANDIDATES.md`

### Step 2: Secondary Database Searches
1. **For content areas 1-4, 6, 8, 10** (broader interest), search:
   - **ScienceDirect** (https://www.sciencedirect.com/)
     - Filter by: Journal category, year 2019-2025, relevant journals
   - **IEEE Xplore** (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) - if applicable for engineering aspects
   - Note: Many papers behind paywall, but can often access through university or download from ResearchGate

2. **For content areas 3, 5, 7** (more specialized):
   - Check **ResearchGate** (https://www.researchgate.net/) for preprints
   - Try **arXiv** (https://arxiv.org/) for working papers
   - Look for PDFs directly from authors' websites

### Step 3: Reference Mining
Once you find 2-3 strong papers in each content area:
1. **Download PDFs and check reference lists**
2. **Look for papers cited frequently** within your content area
3. **Identify author networks** - repeated authors often publish on same topic
4. **Check for more recent citing papers** - Google Scholar shows "Cited by" links

### Step 4: Evaluation Using Template
For **every paper candidate**:
1. Read title and abstract
2. Skim introduction and conclusion
3. Check journal and citation count
4. Evaluate using the **Paper Evaluation Template** above
5. Mark as: ACCEPT, SHORTLIST, SUPPLEMENTARY, or REJECT
6. Record in `PAPER_CANDIDATES.md`

### Step 5: Selection Criteria
**Minimum requirements for ACCEPT (CORE paper):**
- Published 2019-2025 (or older if 30+ citations/year)
- Peer-reviewed in recognized journal
- **HRS-specific** (mentions "refueling," "fueling station," "HRS" in abstract, NOT just "hydrogen infrastructure")
- Methodology clearly explained
- Contains empirical data, simulations, or case studies
- Addresses at least one thesis focus area (Regulatory, Logistical, Technical, Scenarios, Economic)

**Ideal paper characteristics:**
- 2022-2025 publication with 10+ citations (shows recent, high-impact work)
- Combines multiple thesis focus areas (e.g., economics + regulatory)
- Data from 2+ regions (useful for comparative analysis)
- Clear recommendations or actionable insights

### Step 6: Target Count
- **Aim for 30-50 candidate papers** after initial searches
- **Evaluate all candidates** using template
- **Select best 10** (one per content area)
- If a content area has 0-1 strong papers, expand search terms
- If a content area has 5+ strong papers, select highest-quality based on recency + citations + empirical strength

### Step 7: Final Verification
Before finalizing 10 papers:
1. Verify each meets ALL quality criteria
2. Check no redundancy (each paper covers different aspect/area)
3. Confirm HRS-specific (reread abstracts for "refueling," "station," "HRS")
4. List where each paper maps to thesis structure (which chapter/section)
5. Document search queries that successfully found each paper

---

## Section 4: Quality Red Flags (REJECT if encountered)

- **Too old:** Published before 2019 AND fewer than 30 citations/year
- **Not HRS-specific:** Discusses "hydrogen infrastructure" generically without HRS focus (production, storage, long-distance pipelines only)
- **No empirical data:** Purely theoretical, no data/simulations/case studies
- **Unrecognized journal:** Not in major academic databases, not peer-reviewed
- **Insufficient rigor:** No methodology explanation, unclear data sources
- **Shallow reference list:** <30 citations (suggests shallow literature engagement)
- **Wrong focus:** About hydrogen production, fuel cells, electrolyzers, NOT refueling stations
- **Duplicate:** Same topic/authors already selected

---

## Section 5: Documentation

As you search and evaluate:

### Track in PAPER_CANDIDATES.md:
```markdown
# Candidate 1
- **Title:** [Full title]
- **Authors:** [First Author et al.]
- **Journal:** [Name + Year]
- **Citations:** [Count from Google Scholar]
- **DOI:** [Link]
- **Content Area:** [Which of 10 areas]
- **Quality Score:** [How many quality checks passed]
- **Status:** [ACCEPT / SHORTLIST / SUPPLEMENTARY / REJECT]
- **Notes:** [Brief evaluation - why accept/reject, which thesis area it supports]
```

### After selecting final 10:
Create a mapping document showing:
- Content Area 1 → Paper Title (Authors, Year)
- Content Area 2 → Paper Title (Authors, Year)
- ... etc.

And how each paper supports your thesis chapters (Regulatory barriers, Logistical challenges, Technical challenges, Integration scenarios, Cost-Benefit Analysis)

---

## Section 6: Troubleshooting

**Problem: Too few results for a query?**
- Broaden search terms (remove AND conditions, use OR instead)
- Try alternate terminology: "hydrogen fueling," "H₂ station," "light-duty," "heavy-duty," "FCEV," "FCT" (fuel cell truck)
- Check if this content area is well-researched (may need supplementary source)

**Problem: Results not HRS-specific?**
- Add negative filters: NOT "hydrogen production" OR "electrolyzer" OR "fuel cell" OR "hydrogen storage"
- Reread abstracts carefully - some papers mention HRS in title but focus on other aspects
- This content area may require review papers or broader sources

**Problem: Can't find 10 papers after 2-week search?**
- Accept best papers from SHORTLIST (slightly lower citation counts but still strong)
- Include 1-2 papers from related areas (hydrogen infrastructure, hydrogen logistics) as supplementary
- Use review papers more heavily
- Consult with advisor on expanding geographic scope or focus areas

---
