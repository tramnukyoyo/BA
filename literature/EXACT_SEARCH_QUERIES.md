## Success Metrics per Content Area

| Area | Min Papers to Find | Ideal | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | Supply chain can be harder - it's more logistics-focused |
| 2 | 2-3 | 4-5 | Should be easy - "challenges" is popular topic |
| 5 | 2-3 | 4-5 | Reliability is niche - may need 3+ searches |
| 6 | 3-4 | 5-6 | Regulatory papers abundant - high selectivity needed |
| 7 | 2-3 | 4-5 | Strategic network design is specialized |
| 9 | 1-2 | 2-3 | Reviews are rare - may only find 1-2 good ones |
| 10 | 2-3 | 4-5 | EU policy papers should be available (AFIR regulation is new) |

## Pro Tips for Searching

1. **Start with PRIMARY queries** - They're most specific
2. **If <3 results:** Try SECONDARY queries or expand to next journal
3. **Citation count:** For 2023-2025 papers, accept 5+ citations; for 2020-2022, aim for 20+
4. **HRS-specific check:** Read abstract for "refueling," "fueling station," or "HRS" - reject generic "hydrogen infrastructure"
5. **Google Scholar sort:** Use "Sort by relevance" first (usually best results), then try "Sort by date" if few results
6. **ProTip:** Check "Cited by" links on promising papers - often find related work
