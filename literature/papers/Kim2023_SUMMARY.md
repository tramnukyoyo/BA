# Kim et al. 2023 - ACCELERATED SUMMARY: Global HRS Infrastructure & Korea Rollout Strategy

## CORE CONTRIBUTION

**Focus:** Global hydrogen infrastructure status + Korea's rollout strategy as model for second-mover countries

**Key Finding:** Infrastructure bottleneck (not technology) limiting HRS deployment globally

---

## HYDROGEN SUPPLY CHAIN

**Production:** 96% from fossil fuels (48% natural gas, 30% oil, 18% coal, only 4% electrolysis)
- **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)** dominates (75%+ hydrogen, but 750°C+ temperature, low efficiency)
- Most economical but not green

**Storage:** Compressed gas standard (35-950 bar depending on application)
- **Cascaded system:** 3-stage pressure optimization (reduces cooling energy)
- Pre-cooling to -40°C for 700 bar dispensing

**Transportation:**
- **Short range (<270 km):** Tube trailers (200-500 bar)
- **Long range (270-1000 km):** Liquid tankers or pipelines
- Pipeline most efficient for long distances

**Refueling:** 700 bar (cars) / 350 bar (buses)

## GLOBAL STATUS BY REGION

**USA:**
- ✅ >90% H₂ from natural gas
- ✅ Uses existing pipelines for transport
- ❌ Uneven distribution (90% stations in California)
- ❌ Only 8 HRS outside California

**Japan:**
- ✅ Leading HRS count globally
- ✅ Prioritizing buses & commercial vehicles
- ⚠️ Target: 800K FCEVs by 2030 (requires massive infrastructure)

**Germany:**
- ✅ 64% of European HRS
- ✅ Focus on trucks
- ❌ Rest of Europe lagging (47.5% FCEVs in Germany & France only)

**China:**
- 🚀 Rapidly scaling buses (government fleets)
- Accelerating to rival Korea

**Australia:**
- ✅ Abundant renewable energy potential
- Working on green hydrogen production
- International partnerships (Japan coal hydrogen project)

## KOREA'S ROLLOUT STRATEGY (Model for Others)

### Production Approach
- **Primary:** Hydrogen as by-product from LNG facilities (cheap, no extra investment)
- **Secondary:** Import liquefied hydrogen
- **Future:** Local electrolysis expansion

### Supply Chain Problem
- Most H₂ transported via pipelines
- **Result:** Uneven geographic distribution across country
- **Solution:** Deploy local extractors + electrolysis in provincial plants

### Government Support
- Subsidies for private HRS installation
- **Target price:** 2,500 won/kg by 2050 (currently much higher)
- Combined 2019 Roadmap + 2022 Basic Plan

### Infrastructure Timeline
- Phased HRS deployment aligned with FCEV targets
- Solve "chicken-and-egg" by government-led coordination

## KEY STATISTICS

| Metric | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Global H₂ from fossil fuels | 96% | Only 4% from electrolysis |
| USA H₂ from NG | >90% | Abundant natural gas |
| EU HRS distribution | 64% in Germany | Extreme concentration |
| EU FCEV distribution | 47.5% in DE+FR | Geographic imbalance |
| CO₂ reduction potential | 60% vs diesel | Per IEA analysis |
| Target FCEVs by 2030 | 2.4M vehicles | IEA 2DS scenario |
| CO₂ emission reduction | ~7% | If 2030 targets met |

---

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR THESIS

1. **Infrastructure is bottleneck, not technology:** HRS deployment lagging vehicle production by >2 years
2. **Geographic concentration problem:** 80%+ infrastructure in single region per country (unbalanced)
3. **Production source matters:** 96% fossil-fuel H₂ limits sustainability claims
4. **Government coordination essential:** Private sector can't solve chicken-and-egg alone
5. **Phased deployment model:** Korea shows how to coordinate vehicle + infrastructure targets

---

## CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED

- ❌ HRS build time: 2+ years (vs. vehicle mass production ready)
- ❌ Site acquisition difficult (land, permits)
- ❌ Cost: $1.5-3.0M per station
- ❌ Uneven regional distribution (80% in one region)
- ❌ Supply chain imbalance (production ≠ demand centers)
- ❌ Green H₂ transition slow (still 96% from fossils)

---

**Key takeaway:** Global HRS infrastructure lags vehicle deployment; Korea's government-led phased approach provides model; geographic concentration and fossil-fuel dominance are major barriers.
