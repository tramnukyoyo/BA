# Atabay & Devrim 2024 - ACCELERATED SUMMARY: PV-Solar HRS Techno-Economic Analysis

## CORE CONTRIBUTION

**Focus:** Techno-economic feasibility of solar-powered on-site HRS using grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) + anion exchange membrane electrolyzer (AEMWE)

**Case Study:** Ankara, Turkey with 1/3/5 MW PV capacity options

**Key Result:** LCOH (Levelized Cost of Hydrogen) = €8.54/kg H₂ for 5 MW PV over 20 years (170 kg/day capacity)

## HRS SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

**Components:**
1. **PV Solar Panels** (1/3/5 MW grid-connected)
2. **AEMWE Electrolyzer** (500 kW, 105 units, 35 bar output, 62.5% efficiency)
3. **Low-pressure buffer tank** (35 bar)
4. **Cascaded high-pressure storage** (3-stage: 350/550/950 bar)
5. **Compressor** (80% isentropic efficiency)
6. **Pre-cooling unit** (-40°C for 700 bar dispensing)
7. **Vehicle dispensers** (700 bar cars / 350 bar buses)

**Daily Demand Modeled:**
- 10 cars × 5 kg/car = 50 kg
- 2 buses × 40 kg/bus = 80 kg
- **Total = 130-170 kg/day** (depending on capacity)

## ADVANTAGES OF ON-SITE SOLAR HRS

**Environmental:**
- ✅ Zero-emission H₂ (green hydrogen from solar)
- ✅ Reduces carbon footprint vs. grid/fossil production
- ✅ Energy independence from centralized grid

**Technical:**
- ✅ Modular AEMWE system (quick start-up, variable output)
- ✅ AEMWE cheaper than PEM electrolyzers (uses cheaper materials)
- ✅ Grid-connected allows grid support when PV excess
- ✅ Addresses renewable intermittency (H₂ as storage buffer)

**Economic:**
- ✅ Levelized cost declining with scale
- ✅ Direct solar-to-H₂ pathway (fewer intermediaries)
- ✅ No supply chain dependency for hydrogen

## TECHNO-ECONOMIC RESULTS

**LCOH (Levelized Cost of Hydrogen) Sensitivity:**

| PV Capacity | Scenario | LCOH €/kg | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 MW | 10-year | €12.50 | High cost, low capacity |
| 3 MW | 15-year | €9.50 | Medium optimum |
| 5 MW | 20-year | **€8.54** | **Best case** |
| 5 MW | 10-year | €15.00 | Short payback hurts economics |

**Key Variables Impact LCOH:**
1. **HRS capacity** (larger = lower per-unit cost)
2. **PV installed capacity** (more solar = more H₂ per day)
3. **System lifetime** (20 years > 10 years by 2-3× LCOH)

## ENERGY EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

**Energy Consumption by Component:**
- **Compressor:** Largest energy consumer (compressing to 950 bar)
- **AEMWE:** ~53.3 kWh/kg H₂ (62.5% efficiency)
- **Pre-cooling unit:** Significant cooling load
- **Cascaded storage:** Reduces cooling energy vs. single-stage
- **Auxiliary:** ~5% of total

**Total System Energy:** ~70-80 kWh/kg H₂ (including all steps)

**Optimization:** 3-stage cascaded storage reduces cooling load vs. single high-pressure tank

---

## HYDROGEN STORAGE STRATEGY: CASCADE SYSTEM

**Why 3-Stage Cascade?**
- Reduces max storage pressure (from 900→950 bar to staged approach)
- Decreases tank size/cost (smaller high-pressure tank needed)
- Optimizes compression steps (not all at 900 bar)
- Reduces cooling energy (partial refueling from lower pressure tanks)

**Refueling Process:**
1. Low-pressure tank (35 bar) → vehicle until pressure equalizes
2. Medium-pressure tank (350 bar) → boost pressure
3. High-pressure tank (950 bar) → final top-up to 700/800 bar vehicle

## APPLICATION SITE: ANKARA, TURKEY

**Location:** Golbasi, Ankara (39.8°N, 32.7°E, 1182 m altitude)
- Good solar potential (Mediterranean/continental climate)
- 2023 meteorological data used for simulation
- Representative of central Turkey/Mediterranean regions

**Why Turkey?**
- ✅ High solar irradiance
- ✅ Growing hydrogen economy interest
- ✅ Potential for decentralized rural hydrogen production
- ✅ Industrial hub applications (buses, trucks)

---

## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS vs. ALTERNATIVES

**On-site Solar HRS (€8.54/kg, 20-yr):**
- ✅ Better than centralized fossil production (€5-8/kg but gray H₂)
- ✅ Comparable to grid-powered electrolysis in high-renewable areas
- ⚠️ Depends on solar irradiance (Turkey favorable)
- ⚠️ Requires long-term payback (20 years)

**vs. Gasoline:**
- Gasoline: €1.20-1.50/liter ≈ €0.15-0.20/km (energy equivalent)
- Solar HRS H₂: €8.54/kg H₂ ≈ €0.21-0.26/km (depending on vehicle efficiency)
- **Close to parity** with long-term horizon & high fuel prices

## POLICY & SCALABILITY IMPLICATIONS

**For Thesis:**
1. **Technical feasibility:** PV-powered HRS proven technically viable
2. **Economic viability:** LCOH declining with scale (€8.54/kg at 5 MW achievable)
3. **Sustainability:** 100% renewable H₂ (if grid supply is also renewable)
4. **Decentralization:** Enables regional HRS without central supply chain
5. **Grid stability:** On-grid PV allows excess solar to grid (demand flexibility)

**Required Support:**
- Long-term subsidies (15-20 year payback period)
- Land/zoning support for PV + HRS co-location
- Regulatory framework for on-grid excess solar export
- Vehicle incentives (to match infrastructure cost)

---

## LIMITATIONS & CONTEXT

- Single-location case study (Ankara specific)
- Simplified demand model (10 cars + 2 buses = limited)
- No grid electricity price variability modeled
- Doesn't account for seasonal solar variation in detail
- Cascade tank costs not fully itemized

---

**Key takeaway:** Solar-powered on-site HRS is techno-economically viable (€8.54/kg in 20-year scenario), particularly in sunny regions like Turkey. Enables decentralized hydrogen production and renewable integration, though requires long-term policy support. Represents promising pathway for regional HRS deployment without supply chain bottlenecks.
