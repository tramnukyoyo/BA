## Paper #1: Raeesi et al. 2024 ✓ COMPLETE

**Focus:** UK hydrogen supply chain & HRS network design for long-haul freight

**Core Insight:** Underground geological storage (salt caverns, LRC, UGP) can reduce total H2 delivery costs by **65%** by shifting major capex to cheaper bulk storage and reducing daily equipment costs.

**Key Numbers Ready for Thesis:**
- Optimal HGV penetration: **13%** (not 100% - breaks chicken-and-egg paradox)
- H2 cost by 2050: **€3.64/kg** (blue, at 20% penetration)
- Storage dominance: **43% of CAPEX** but only **8% of OPEX** (counterintuitive finding)
- Safety stock needed: **9 days early**, **5 days mature** (affects reliability vs. cost)
- UK HRS candidate sites: **539 locations** (382 warehouses, 111 service stations, 46 ports)

**Framework Mapping:**
- **Dimension 1 (Challenges):** Addresses logistical + technical barriers
- **Dimension 2 (Analysis):** Spatial optimization + economic viability
- **Dimension 3 (Scenarios):** Corridor-based HGV corridors + industrial hub ports

**Thesis Chapter Integration:**
- Excellent for: Supply chain economics, case study example, policy implications
- Ready to cite: 4 direct quotes extracted
- Data quality: High (peer-reviewed, IJHE, 14 citations in field)

**Summary Document:** `Raeesi2024_SUMMARY.md` (12 sections, 275 lines)

## Paper #2: Isaac & Saha 2023 ✓ COMPLETE

**Focus:** Comprehensive review of HRS location optimization methods; gap analysis

**Core Insight:** Flow-based models (FRLM/FCLM) outperform point-demand models (P-median) by **5-10%** on coverage, and safety/rural contexts remain **critical unaddressed gaps** in current optimization models.

**Key Models Reviewed & Ranked:**
1. **P-median model** - Most popular; minimizes travel distance (urban focus)
2. **FRLM/FCLM** - Better performance; captures flow-based refueling behavior
3. **Multi-criteria** - Emerging; integrates cost + safety + capacity
4. **Agent-based simulation** - Models chicken-and-egg dynamics
5. **Bass diffusion + FCLM** - Links vehicle adoption to infrastructure growth

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- ❌ **Safety integration** - No models explicitly include safety in optimization
- ❌ **Rural context** - All models urban-focused; rural applicability unproven
- ❌ **Cost integration** - Few models include construction/operation costs
- ❌ **Reproducibility** - Agent-based simulations show high initial-condition dependency

**Key Numbers:**
- **8+ optimization models** systematically reviewed
- **51 references** across diverse fields
- **Flow model advantage:** ~5-10% better coverage than point models
- **Vehicle range impact:** 4hr range → 15 stations; 12hr range → 5 stations

**Framework Mapping:**
- **Dimension 2 (Analysis):** Provides complete spatial planning methodology toolkit
- **Dimension 1 (Challenges):** Identifies safety + rural context as critical gaps
- **Dimension 3 (Scenarios):** Flow models designed for corridors; point models for urban

**Thesis Chapter Integration:**
- Excellent for: Methodology chapter (model selection), gap identification, spatial planning
- Ready to cite: 7 direct quotes extracted; 51 references for deeper dives
- Data quality: High (comprehensive literature review, 50 papers analyzed)

**Summary Document:** `Isaac2023_SUMMARY.md` (15 sections, includes model taxonomy & gap analysis)

## Paper #3: Wu et al. 2024 ✓ COMPLETE

**Focus:** Economic analysis of HRS operation modes comparing costs by distance and infrastructure type

**Core Insight:** **On-site hydrogen production uneconomical** at 35.24 CNY/kg; **off-site with pipeline is optimal** (22-26 CNY/kg at 100% utilization), but requires **network coordination**. Distance determines optimal mode: <270km = tube trailer; 270-1000km = liquid tanker; all distances with pipeline if 100% utilization achieved.

**Key Numbers Ready for Thesis:**
- On-site production cost: **35.24 CNY/kg** (€4.41/kg) - UNECONOMICAL vs 35 CNY/kg target
- Pipeline cost: **22.44 CNY/kg** at 100km, 100% utilization (lowest cost)
- Liquid tanker: **30.62 CNY/kg** at 300km (stable across distances)
- Tube trailer: **31.12 CNY/kg** at 300km (economical cutoff)
- Hydrogen supply cost: **>50% of LCOH** for off-site stations
- Pipeline sensitivity: Cost varies 2.54 → 7.99 CNY/kg (100% → 20% utilization at 300km)

**Framework Mapping:**
- **Dimension 1 (Challenges):** Economic feasibility barrier; on-site not viable
- **Dimension 2 (Analysis):** Economic viability assessment models (annualized + LCOH)
- **Dimension 3 (Scenarios):** Mode selection by distance (corridor = tanker; hub = pipeline; industrial = distributed)

**Thesis Chapter Integration:**
- Excellent for: Economic viability chapter, cost-benefit analysis, infrastructure trade-offs
- Ready to cite: 7 direct quotes extracted; detailed cost tables
- Data quality: High (peer-reviewed, IJHE 2024, comprehensive modeling)

**Summary Document:** `Wu2024_SUMMARY.md` (15 sections, includes cost models, sensitivity analysis, mode comparison)
