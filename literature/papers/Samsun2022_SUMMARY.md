# Samsun et al. 2022 - ACCELERATED SUMMARY: Global FCV & HRS Market Status

## KEY FINDINGS

**Global FCV Fleet (End 2021):** 51,437 vehicles
- **Top 4 countries: 90% of global fleet**
  - South Korea: 33,151 (64%)
  - USA: 12,358 (24%)
  - China: 8,214 (16%)
  - Japan: 6,770 (13%)
- Germany: 2,000+ (only non-top-4 surpassing 1,000)

**Global HRS Network:** 729 stations operational
- Japan: highest station count
- Concentrated in 4 countries (>80%)

**Growth Trend:** 2021 highest annual addition of vehicles & stations

## VEHICLE BREAKDOWN BY CLASS

| Class | Count | % | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Passenger cars | ~40,000 | 78% | Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo dominant |
| Buses | ~6,000 | 12% | Korea/China buses growing fast |
| Light Commercial | ~2,000 | 4% | Vans (Renault, Mercedes, Ford) |
| Medium Trucks | ~2,000 | 4% | Emerging category |
| Heavy Trucks | ~400 | 1% | Early market stage |

**Key insight:** Passenger cars dominate; buses & trucks emerging (different infrastructure needs than cars)

---

## COUNTRY-LEVEL STRATEGIES

**South Korea:** Leads deployment; government subsidies + corporate backing (Hyundai/Kia); target 2M FCVs by 2040

**USA (California):** 50% of US FCVs; public-private partnerships; federal + state incentives

**China:** Rapidly scaling buses (government fleets); targets to rival Korea by 2030

**Japan:** First-mover in cars (Toyota Mirai); bus programs; targets 800K FCVs by 2030

**Germany:** Leading European market; focus on trucks + buses; hydrogen infrastructure integration

**Europe:** Fragmented; varies by country; some lagging (few HRS outside Germany)

---

## POLICY INCENTIVES REVIEWED

**Common mechanisms:**
- Purchase subsidies ($5K-$15K per vehicle)
- Free/discounted parking
- Road tax exemptions
- Public charging network investment
- Hydrogen price regulation

**Effectiveness:** Strong incentives in Korea/California drive adoption; weaker EU policies explain lag

## DATA METHODOLOGY

**Survey period:** End of 2021 (5th annual survey by IEA Advanced Fuel Cells TCP)
**Scope:** Road vehicles only (not material handling, trains, ships)
**Sources:** AFC TCP members + IEA global database + cross-checks
**Rigor:** Only operating vehicles counted (not prototypes or planned)

## TREND ANALYSIS (2017-2021)

**FCV Growth:**
- 2017: ~6,500 vehicles
- 2021: 51,437 vehicles
- **CAGR: ~65% annually** (exponential growth)

**HRS Growth:**
- 2017: ~150 stations
- 2021: 729 stations
- **CAGR: ~50% annually**

**Ratio:** ~1 station per 70 vehicles (increases as market matures)

**2021 Special:** Highest annual new vehicles (21,000+) + stations (100+) in single year

## FUTURE TARGETS (National Roadmaps)

| Country | 2030 Target | 2040 Target | Vehicle Class Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| South Korea | 620K | 2M+ | All classes (cars primary) |
| Japan | 800K | 5M | All classes |
| Germany | 500K+ | Multiple M | Trucks priority |
| USA/California | 250K | 1M+ | Cars + trucks |
| China | 1M+ | Multi-M | Buses + trucks |
| EU (combined) | 400K+ | 2M+ | Mixed |

**Gap analysis:** Current 51K vs. 2030 targets of 2M+ = **40× growth needed in 9 years** (requires massive acceleration)

---

## THESIS RELEVANCE

**Global market perspective:** Shows HRS deployment is concentration-based (80% in 4 countries); regional strategies matter

**Technology readiness:** FCV technology proven; market is policy/incentive driven, not technology barrier

**Infrastructure-vehicle co-evolution:** HRS must parallel vehicle adoption; leads in Korea, lags in Europe

**Heavy-duty emerging:** Buses & trucks growing segment; different HRS requirements (higher throughput, different locations)

---

## LIMITATIONS

- Snapshot data (end 2021); current market evolved
- Limited detail on HRS capacity/specifications
- Incentive data summarized (not exhaustive cost-benefit)
- Doesn't address hydrogen production source (green vs. gray)

---

**Key takeaway:** Global FCV market is concentrated but rapidly growing; HRS deployment lags vehicle growth; Korea shows model for successful coordination; Europe lagging due to fragmentation & weaker incentives.
