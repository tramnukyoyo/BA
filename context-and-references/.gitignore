# Context and References Git Ignore

# Uncomment below if you want to store PDFs separately (cloud storage)
# and keep the repository lean
# This is useful if you accumulate many large reference files

# PDF files (uncomment to exclude from git)
# *.pdf

# Microsoft Word documents (uncomment to exclude)
# *.docx
# *.doc

# Large files
# *.zip
# *.rar

# Backup files
*.bak
*.backup
*~

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Note: By default, metadata.txt and notes.md files ARE tracked in git
# This keeps your analysis and metadata in version control while allowing
# you to optionally exclude large binary files if desired
