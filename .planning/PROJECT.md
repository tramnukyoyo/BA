# Wasserstoffinfrastruktur in globalen Lieferketten

## What This Is

A comprehensive bachelor's thesis analyzing the regulatory, logistical, technical, and economic barriers to global hydrogen infrastructure deployment, with evidence-based implementation strategies bridging the "chicken-and-egg" problem between supply and demand.

## Core Value

Synthesize fragmented global research on hydrogen infrastructure into an actionable framework that enables decision-makers (policymakers, energy companies, infrastructure operators) to prioritize implementation strategies by geographic and resource context.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Exposé structure with 8 chapters and 3 hierarchical research questions — Phase 1
- ✓ 11 academic sources in Harvard format collected and integrated — Phase 1
- ✓ LaTeX compilation working (UTF-8, pifont package) — Phase 1
- ✓ Exposé PDF (10 pages) draft generated — Phase 1

### Active

- [ ] Final research question validation and refinement
- [ ] Bibliography expansion (11 sources → 40+ for thesis)
- [ ] Ausganglage refinement with specific H₂ project examples
- [ ] Scope validation: Is 8 chapters appropriate for bachelor thesis?
- [ ] Detailed thesis outline with section-level arguments
- [ ] Chapter 1: Introduction (4-6 pages) with clear problem framing
- [ ] Chapter 2: Literature Review (12-15 pages) covering regulatory, technical, logistical, economic barriers
- [ ] Chapter 3: Regulatory Analysis (8-10 pages) covering ISO, EU, US, China frameworks
- [ ] Chapter 4: Logistics & Technical Infrastructure (10-12 pages) with cost breakdowns
- [ ] **Chapter 4: SWOT Analysis for Implementation Scenarios** (1-2 pages) — Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats for decentralized clusters, regional backbone, intercontinental transport models
- [ ] Chapter 5: Implementation Strategies & Outlook (8-10 pages) with evidence-based recommendations
- [ ] **Chapter 5: SWOT Analysis for Regional Strategies** (1-2 pages) — Comparative SWOT for European, Asian, and Australian hydrogen initiatives
- [ ] **Chapter 5: SWOT Analysis for Governance Mechanisms** (1-2 pages) — Analyze PPPs, financing, standardization, and regulatory coordination models
- [ ] Chapter 6: Sustainability & Impact Assessment (10-12 pages) including Nutzwertanalyse framework
- [ ] **Chapter 6: Nutzwertanalyse (Value Utility Analysis)** (2-3 pages) — Systematic scoring of implementation scenarios against criteria (cost, feasibility, sustainability, timeline, scalability)
- [ ] Scoring matrix and criteria definition for Nutzwertanalyse
- [ ] Executive summary in German
- [ ] Final PDF compilation (50-70 pages target)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile application development — This is a research thesis, not a tool
- Real-time hydrogen market tracking system — Beyond thesis scope, would be standalone project
- Comprehensive global patent review — Limited to strategy frameworks
- Advanced LCA modeling beyond literature synthesis — Use existing studies, don't conduct own experiments
- Pilot project implementation — Research and recommendations only

## Context

**Bachelor thesis project** in the context of energy transition, focused on hydrogen as critical enabler of decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors (steel, chemicals, long-haul transport).

**Prior work completed:**
- Literature foundation: 12 academic sources collected (Hydrogen Council, IEA, McKinsey, Arup, etc.)
- Peer template analysis: Extracted structure from colleague's exposé
- Draft generation: 8-chapter exposé with 3 RQs, 11 bibliography sources, concept map
- LaTeX setup: Compilation issues resolved (UTF-8 encoding, pifont package)

**Known context:**
- University is University Duisburg-Essen (UDE)
- Language: German academic register (active voice, formal tone)
- Citation style: Harvard (author-date)
- Deadline: ~4 months for full thesis after exposé approval
- Previous interruption: Session paused mid-refinement (Jan 31, 2026)

## Constraints

- **Timeline:** 14 days for exposé completion + professor approval gate → then 14 weeks for thesis writing
- **Scope:** Bachelor thesis constraints (50-70 pages, not comprehensive monograph)
- **Language:** German output required (academic register, modern active voice)
- **Bibliography:** Minimum 40-50 sources for thesis credibility
- **Technical:** LaTeX/BibTeX required (UDE template constraint)
- **Access:** Limited to published/open-access research (no proprietary industry data)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use 3 hierarchical research questions | Scope management: RQ1 (technical/economic viability) → RQ2 (governance/coordination) → RQ3 (sustainability trade-offs) | ✓ Good — allows nested analysis |
| Structure as 8 chapters in exposé | Comprehensive coverage of all dimensions (introduction, theory, projects, scenarios, governance, sustainability, discussion, summary) | — Pending — needs scope validation (is 8 too ambitious?) |
| Focus on implementation strategies, not technology R&D | Thesis is applied research, not pure science | ✓ Good — aligns with bachelor thesis scope |
| Harvard citations + BibTeX | Consistency with UDE template requirements | ✓ Good — working in LaTeX |
| Peer template as structural reference | Accelerated draft generation from working example | ✓ Good — baseline created quickly |
| Use comprehensive SWOT Analysis (3 dimensions) | Systematic evaluation of implementation scenarios, regional strategies, and governance mechanisms | ✓ Good — provides structured comparative framework |
| Use Nutzwertanalyse for scenario ranking | Quantitative utility analysis enables evidence-based prioritization of infrastructure models | ✓ Good — bridges qualitative insights with decision-making criteria |
| Place analyses in Chapter 6 (Sustainability & Impact Assessment) | Consolidate evaluation frameworks with sustainability and economic assessment | ✓ Good — natural integration point with LCA and cost analysis |
