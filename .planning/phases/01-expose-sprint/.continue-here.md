# Session Handoff: Phase 1 — Exposé Sprint

## Current State

**You are in:** Phase 1, Week 2, Days 8-14 (Final Refinement)
**What happened this session:** Integrated SWOT Analysis and Nutzwertanalyse into thesis planning
**Status:** Exposé draft exists (10 pages), ready for content review and refinement

---

## Completed Work (This Session)

✅ **Planning Integration:**
- Reviewed exposé draft structure and current 8-chapter outline
- Asked clarifying questions about SWOT and Nutzwertanalyse scope
- Defined approach:
  - **SWOT:** Comprehensive (3 analyses: scenarios, regions, governance)
  - **Nutzwertanalyse:** Ranks implementation scenarios by utility
  - **Placement:** Main analysis in Chapter 6 (Sustainability & Impact Assessment)

✅ **Updated All Planning Documents:**
- `PROJECT.md`: Added 5 new requirements for analyses
- `ROADMAP.md`:
  - Extended phase structure from 5 to 6 phases
  - Added detailed tasks for analysis framework development (Phase 2)
  - Added integration tasks (Phases 3-4)
  - Updated timeline: ~4.5 months (from 4 months)
  - Updated page budget: 83 pages (from 59 pages)
- `STATE.md`: Documented new decisions and updated blockers

✅ **Created Task Tracking:**
- Created 18 actionable tasks in todo list for analysis development
- Tasks span from framework definition (Phase 2) through execution (Phase 4)

## Remaining Work (Phase 1 — Days 8-14)

⏳ **Days 8-10: Content Validation** (NEXT PRIORITIES)
- [ ] Review `expose/expose.pdf` for structure coherence
- [ ] **Validate 3 research questions** against your vision (critical decision point)
- [ ] Update bibliography with 3-5 H₂-specific sources (H2Future, HyDelta, HEAVENN)
- [ ] Enhance Ausgangslage with 2-3 concrete H₂ project examples/statistics
- [ ] Verify Problemstellung clearly identifies research gap
- [ ] Confirm 8-chapter scope is manageable
- [ ] **NEW:** Validate SWOT + Nutzwertanalyse scope (appears integrated cleanly)

⏳ **Days 11-12: Language & Polish**
- [ ] Academic German review (formal register, active voice)
- [ ] Consistency check (terminology, citation format, typography)
- [ ] Refine concept map visual

⏳ **Days 13-14: Final Submission Prep**
- [ ] Final PDF compilation
- [ ] Proofread complete draft
- [ ] **Deliverable:** `expose/exposé-final.pdf` (ready for professor)

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Why | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| SWOT Analysis: 3 dimensions (scenarios + regions + governance) | Systematic comparative framework strengthens thesis | ✓ Approved |
| Nutzwertanalyse: Ranks scenarios by weighted criteria | Evidence-based prioritization bridges qualitative insights and decisions | ✓ Approved |
| Place analyses in Chapters 4, 5, 6 (distributed) | Natural integration points: after describing scenarios, before final assessment | ✓ Approved |
| Extend thesis to full 8 chapters with sustainability chapter | Provides coherent structure for comprehensive analysis | ✓ Approved |
| Increase page target to ~83 pages | Still within bachelor thesis norms (60-100 pages) | ✓ Approved |

**Critical Decision Still Pending:**
- ⚠️ **Research Questions validation** — Do your 3 RQs match your actual thesis focus?
  - Current RQs are reasonable but generic
  - Need your confirmation they capture what you actually want to analyze

---

## Current Blockers

- ⚠️ **RQ Alignment:** Current research questions are generic H₂ framework questions. Unclear if they match YOUR specific thesis direction. Needs user validation.
- ⚠️ **Bibliography Specificity:** 11 sources are generic. Need 5+ hydrogen-infrastructure-specific papers for credibility.
- ⚠️ **Ausgangslage Concreteness:** Problem statement is generic. Needs 2-3 real project examples to ground the thesis.

---

## Mental Context / Approach

**The thesis is growing:**
- Original: 8-chapter exposé with 50-70 page thesis (5 chapters + appendices)
- New: Full 8-chapter structure (Chapters 1-8) with comprehensive analyses
- Why: SWOT + Nutzwertanalyse provide structured evaluation frameworks that naturally require dedicated chapters for synthesis (Ch. 6) and discussion (Ch. 7)

**Timeline implication:**
- Phase 1: Exposé refinement (14 days) — submit to professor
- Phase 2: Foundation + analysis prep (4 weeks) — define SWOT criteria and Nutzwertanalyse matrix
- Phase 3: Writing Chapters 1-4 + Scenario SWOT research (6 weeks)
- Phase 4: **Chapters 5-6 + ALL analyses** (2 weeks) — the critical phase
- Phase 5: Chapters 7-8 (1 week)
- Phase 6: Final polish (2 weeks)
- **Total:** ~16 weeks post-approval

**Analysis Integration Approach:**
- SWOT is NOT a standalone section but integrated into relevant chapters
- Chapters 4-5: Brief SWOT summaries (1-2 pages each) to evaluate specific options
- Chapter 6: Main evaluation chapter with detailed Nutzwertanalyse framework
- Chapters 7-8: Reference back to analyses when making recommendations

## Files Modified (Not Yet Committed)

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — Added analysis requirements
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — Extended phases, added tasks, updated budget
- `.planning/STATE.md` — Updated decisions and blockers
- `.planning/phases/01-expose-sprint/` — New directory created

---

## Next Actions (When Resuming)

**Immediate (Session 2, Days 8-10):**
1. Open `expose/expose.pdf` and review for structure/flow
2. **DECISION POINT:** Validate your 3 research questions
   - Are they capturing what you want to study?
   - Do they feel too broad/narrow?
   - Should any be reframed?
3. Start bibliography enhancement (add H₂-specific sources)
4. Add concrete examples to Ausgangslage

**Medium-term (Days 11-14):**
5. Polish German language and finalize exposé
6. Get professor feedback/approval (GATE for Phase 2)

**After approval:**
7. Begin Phase 2: Define SWOT criteria for all 3 dimensions
8. Create Nutzwertanalyse evaluation matrix
   - Start with: What 8-10 criteria matter for choosing between scenarios?
   - Examples: capex, opex, timeline, sustainability, scalability, regulatory readiness, job creation, energy independence

**Session summary:** Significantly strengthened thesis planning by integrating two rigorous analytical frameworks (SWOT + Nutzwertanalyse). Planning docs updated. Task list created. Ready to proceed with exposé refinement once RQs are validated.
