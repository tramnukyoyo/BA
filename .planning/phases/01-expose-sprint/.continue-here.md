## ⏳ Remaining Work (Days 8-14)

### Task 5: Review & Refine Content (Days 8-10)

**What to do:**
- [ ] **Open and review** `expose/expose_bachelor.pdf`
- [ ] **Check alignment:** Do the 3 RQs match what you actually want to study?
- [ ] **Assess tone:** Does the German academic register feel right?
- [ ] **Verify structure:** Does the problem progression (Ausgangslage → Problemstellung → RQs) make sense?
- [ ] **Make notes** on any content you want to adjust

**Key questions to consider:**
1. Are the 4 barrier dimensions (regulatory, technical, economic, logistical) the right focus?
2. Are the 3 regions (EU, Asia-Pac, Australia) appropriate, or should you focus on different regions?
3. Does the Benchmarking + CBA methodology feel like it will answer your RQs?

### Task 6: Expand Bibliography (Days 8-11)

**Current:** 15 sources (general foundation)

**Target:** 30-40 sources (H₂-infrastructure specific)

**What to add (priority order):**

1. **EU Hydrogen Backbone Projects**
   - Hydrogen Europe reports
   - Gas4Europe infrastructure analyses
   - HEAVENN project outputs

2. **Regional Strategies**
   - Japan METI Hydrogen Roadmap
   - South Korea hydrogen plans
   - Australia Hydrogen Headstart Scheme documents
   - German H₂Leitmarkt strategy

3. **Infrastructure Economics**
   - Hydrogen pipeline cost analyses
   - Electrolyzer cost curves (2025-2030)
   - Transport economics (pipeline vs. maritime vs. trucks)

4. **Supply Chain Integration**
   - H₂ supply chain case studies
   - Demand projection studies
   - Matching demand-supply strategies

**Format:** Maintain Harvard author-date style throughout

**File:** Create `expose/references_h2.bib` with expanded sources

### Task 7: Polish & Submit (Days 11-14)

**Days 11-12: Final Refinement**
- [ ] Academic German language review (formal register, active voice "Ich analysiere..." style)
- [ ] Concept Map visual clarity check
- [ ] Consistency check across document (terminology, citation formatting, typography)
- [ ] Verify all citations use Harvard format

**Days 13-14: Submission Preparation**
- [ ] Final PDF compilation with expanded bibliography
- [ ] Create submission package:
  ```
  Exposé_YourName.pdf
  References.bib (or inline bibliography)
  Optional: Cover letter (1 paragraph explaining scope & methodology)
  ```
- [ ] **SUBMIT to professor**

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Bachelor scope (50 pages, 6 chapters)** | Corrected over-ambitious master-thesis structure. Standard bachelor format appropriate. | ✅ Approved |
| **Benchmarking + CBA methodology** | Chosen from professor's list. Benchmarking compares regions objectively; CBA quantifies viability. Evidence-based, achievable for bachelor thesis. | ✅ Approved |
| **3 regional focus (EU, Asia-Pac, Australia)** | Represent different implementation contexts: coordinated backbone, import-dependent, export-focused. Provides comparative insights. | ✅ Approved |
| **4 barrier dimensions** | Regulatory, technical, economic, logistical. Systematic framework for assessment. All crucial to infrastructure deployment. | ✅ Approved |
| **Convert to LaTeX** | Aligns with UDE template requirements. Better for academic formatting and bibliography management. | ✅ Done |

## 🧠 Mental Context / Approach

### Why This Methodology?

**Benchmarking (Vergleichende Analyse):**
- Systematically compares 3 regions across 4 dimensions
- Objective, data-driven (not opinion-based)
- Shows what works where and why
- Identifies best practices and region-specific barriers

**Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):**
- Quantifies economic viability
- Calculates NPV, ROI, break-even points
- Shows which strategies have strongest economics
- Makes recommendations measurable

**Why together?** Because infrastructure investment decisions need BOTH objective comparison AND economic justification. Your thesis will show WHAT strategies exist (benchmarking) and WHETHER they make economic sense (CBA).

### The Thesis Flow

```
Einleitung (Why this matters)
    ↓
Theoretische Grundlagen (What is hydrogen? Supply chain concepts? Barriers?)
    ↓
Methodik (HOW we will analyze: Benchmarking framework + CBA model)
    ↓
Ergebnisse (WHAT we found: Benchmarking matrix + CBA results + Sensitivity)
    ↓
Diskussion (WHAT IT MEANS: Interpret findings, answer RQs, limitations)
    ↓
Fazit (SO WHAT: Recommendations and implications)
```

### Next Phase Preview (Post-Approval)

**Phase 2 (2 weeks):** Build analysis frameworks
- Detailed benchmarking criteria (what metrics for each dimension?)
- CBA model specification (what costs? what benefits? what assumptions?)
- Literature review for Theoretische Grundlagen chapter

**Phase 3 (3 weeks):** Write Chapters 1-2
- Einleitung: Problem statement, RQs, thesis outline
- Theoretische Grundlagen: H₂ technology, supply chains, barriers, regional context

**Phase 4 (2 weeks):** Results + Analysis
- Chapter 4 Ergebnisse: Benchmarking matrix + CBA calculations
- Sensitivity analysis: How do policy changes affect outcomes?

**Phase 5-6:** Interpretation + Finishing
- Chapters 5-6: Discussion, conclusions, recommendations

**I will provide detailed step-by-step guidance when you reach Phases 2-3**, especially for:
- Building the benchmarking matrix (what data sources? how to score regions?)
- Setting up CBA calculations (cost categories, benefit metrics, NPV formula)
- Interpreting results (answering your research questions)

## ⚠️ Known Constraints & Assumptions

**Timeline:**
- 14 days total for exposé (you're on Day 8)
- ~6 days remaining for review + polish + submission
- Must submit before moving to Phase 2

**Scope:**
- Bachelor thesis = 50 pages maximum (not 80+)
- 6 chapters (not 8)
- Benchmarking + CBA is the research method (not exploratory)

**Bibliography:**
- Minimum 30 sources for credibility
- Focus on hydrogen infrastructure, supply chains, regional strategies
- Harvard format mandatory (UDE requirement)
