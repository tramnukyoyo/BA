## 🧠 Mental Context

### What Was Accomplished
This was a complete 5-session sprint to create a research-grounded exposé from scratch:
- Started with generic hydrogen infrastructure knowledge
- Found 10 highly relevant, recent papers (2023-2025)
- Integrated specific data points into every section
- Built professional German-language document
- Achieved 100% completion on schedule

### Key Insight
The exposé went from being generic to being **evidence-based**. Every major claim now has a paper backing it:
- Implementation gap (95%) — Odenweller
- Cost ranges (€3.80-€11.70/kg) — Chung, Eißler
- Regional differences — METI, EU Commission, papers
- Technical trade-offs — Prokopou, Vizza
- Barrier framework — ECH2A, Sujan

### Approach Used
1. **Parallelization:** While waiting for one paper to process, moved on to next work
2. **Grounded RQs:** Made sure research questions emerged from paper findings
3. **Iterative refinement:** Rewrite > compile > verify > commit cycle
4. **German polish:** Ensured formal academic register throughout (active voice, consistency)

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All 10 papers verified as relevant before inclusion
- ✅ 22 citations checked (all resolved in final PDF)
- ✅ Bibliography alphabetical and complete
- ✅ German language reviewed for academic register
- ✅ PDF passes visual inspection (professional formatting)

---

## ⚠️ Notes for Next Phase

### When Professor Gives Feedback
If revisions needed, main areas that can be quickly adjusted:
- Ausgangslage: Add/modify empirical examples
- Forschungsfragen: Refine RQ wording
- Gliederung: Reorder chapters if needed
- Bibliography: Add 10-15 more supporting papers for thesis writing

### Before Starting Phase 2
- ✅ Have professor approval in hand
- ✅ Clarify any feedback on RQs
- ✅ Confirm scope (6 chapters, ~50 pages)
- ✅ Plan timeline (14 weeks)

### Resources Available
- All 10 papers in searchable text format (C:\Users\denny\Bachelorarbeit\literature\*.txt)
- Harvard citations ready for copy-paste
- LaTeX template proven to work
- Methodology framework already defined in Methodik section
