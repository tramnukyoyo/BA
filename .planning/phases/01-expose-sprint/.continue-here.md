# Continue Here — Phase 1: Exposé Sprint (REBUILD)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13 14:35 UTC+1
**Phase:** 01-expose-sprint (HRS-Specific Focus Rebuild)
**Status:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS — 60% Complete

---

## Current State

You are **in the middle of Phase 1: Exposé Rebuild** with HRS-specific focus. The rebuild was triggered because the original exposé addressed "general hydrogen infrastructure" when the actual thesis is specifically about **Hydrogen Refueling Station (HRS) implementation strategies and challenges**.

**What just happened (this session):**
1. ✅ Evaluated 7 new HRS papers you found through targeted searches
2. ✅ Selected 9 final core papers + 1 supplementary paper for bibliography
3. ✅ Created `references_h2_CORE.bib` with all 9 papers in BibTeX format
4. ✅ Cleaned up expose folder (archived 30+ outdated files)
5. ✅ Updated `expose_bachelor.tex` to use new bibliography
6. ✅ Added strategic citations throughout document
7. ✅ Compiled LaTeX successfully (expose_bachelor.pdf generated)

**Current position:** Ready for final review before submission

## Remaining Work

### Critical Path to Submission (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Decision Needed: Old Citations**

The document contains citations to papers NOT in references_h2_CORE.bib (Odenweller2025, EUCommission2020, etc.). You have two options:

**Option A: Clean (RECOMMENDED)**
- Remove old citations from expose_bachelor.tex
- Use only core 9 papers
- Cleaner, focused, more powerful

**Option B: Supplementary**
- Add old 10 papers to references_h2_CORE.bib as supplementary section
- Keep document as-is
- More comprehensive but less focused

**After deciding:**
1. Execute the fix
2. Final LaTeX compile: `pdflatex → biber → pdflatex`
3. Review PDF (all citations render, professional formatting)
4. Submit to professor

## Next Action When Resuming
