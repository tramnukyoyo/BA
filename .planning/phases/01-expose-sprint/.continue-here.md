## ⏳ Current Task: Task 6 — Bibliography Rebuild (Days 8-11)

**Status:** Starting HIGH PRIORITY paper searches

**Current:** 2/15 core papers found (METI 2023, NREL 2024) — awaiting validation
**Target:** 15/15 core papers found → 30-40 total sources (core + supporting)

### HIGH PRIORITY Papers (Search First) — ESSENTIAL FOR THESIS

| # | Paper | Topic | Search Query | Priority |
|---|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **10** | **CBA Methodology** | Economic viability framework | `"cost-benefit analysis" hydrogen infrastructure NPV` | 🔴 FIRST |
| **11** | **Barriers & Strategies** | Deployment barriers + solutions | `hydrogen infrastructure deployment barriers "chicken-and-egg"` | 🔴 SECOND |
| **4** | **EU Strategy** | EU Commission 2020 policy | `"hydrogen strategy for a carbon-neutral Europe" EC 2020` | 🔴 THIRD |
| **5** | **EU Roadmap** | EU infrastructure implementation | `"Hydrogen Roadmap Europe" 2022 Hydrogen Europe` | 🔴 FOURTH |

### MEDIUM PRIORITY Papers (Search After High) — STRENGTHEN ANALYSIS

| # | Paper | Topic | When |
|---|-------|-------|------|
| 9 | Supply Chain Integration | Production-HRS coordination | After high priority |
| 13 | Asia-Pacific Comparison | Regional benchmarking (Japan/Korea/Australia) | After high priority |
| 14 | EU Supply Chain | European integration | Fill gaps |
| 15 | Multi-Regional Comparison | Global/comparative H₂ study | Fill gaps |

### LOWER PRIORITY Papers (Optional) — FILL REMAINING GAPS

Papers 1, 2, 3, 8, 12 — add if time permits after core papers

## 📋 Search & Validation Workflow

**For Each Paper You Find:**

1. **Search** using exact queries from `literature/search_strategies for expose.md`
   - Google Scholar, ResearchGate, institutional repositories
   - Look for open-access versions or PDFs
   - Target peer-reviewed or official government documents

2. **Download & Save**
   - Place PDF in: `C:\Users\denny\Bachelorarbeit\literature\`
   - Name format: `AuthorYear_Topic.pdf` (e.g., `IEA2021_Future_Hydrogen.pdf`)

3. **Tell me:** "Found Paper X (title), file: [filename]"
   - I will review the PDF
   - Verify it matches thesis component
   - Assess quality and relevance
   - Extract Harvard citation metadata
   - Update BIBLIOGRAPHY_CHECKLIST.md with ✔ REVIEWED status

4. **Continue searching** while I validate previous papers
   - Parallel workflow = faster bibliography completion

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Use 15-core + 15-25-supporting model | Focused depth + supporting breadth for bachelor thesis | ✅ Approved |
| Search HIGH PRIORITY papers first (4 papers) | CBA, barriers, EU strategy are non-negotiable for thesis structure | ✅ Prioritized |
| You search, I validate workflow | You maintain paper selection control; I ensure quality + citations | ✅ Active workflow |
| Bachelor-level scope (6 chapters, ~50 pages) | Appropriate for bachelor thesis; manageable timeline | ✅ Confirmed |
| Benchmarking + CBA methodology | Objective regional comparison + economic viability quantification | ✅ Foundational |

## 🧠 Mental Context & Approach

### Why Bibliography is Critical Now

Your exposé structure is solid, but the bibliography is the **foundation** for credibility and thesis writing:

1. **CBA Methodology (Paper 10)** — You MUST have rigorous economic analysis framework
2. **Barriers Framework (Paper 11)** — Validates problem statement systematically
3. **EU Documents (Papers 4-5)** — Provide authoritative baseline for benchmarking
4. **Regional Papers (Papers 13-15)** — Enable meaningful comparison across 3 regions

Without these, thesis becomes generic. **With them**, analysis is evidence-based.

### The Bibliography as Your Thesis Backbone

```
Exposé Draft ✓ (done)
    ↓
Bibliography 30-40 sources ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
Chapter 1 (Einleitung) — Uses sources to frame problem
    ↓
Chapter 2 (Grundlagen) — Uses sources to explain concepts
    ↓
Chapter 3 (Methodik) — Uses CBA/benchmarking sources
    ↓
Chapter 4 (Ergebnisse) — Analysis grounded in source data
    ↓
Chapter 5 (Diskussion) — Uses sources for interpretation
    ↓
Chapter 6 (Fazit) — Uses sources for conclusions
```

Every chapter will reference your bibliography. Getting this right **now** saves time later.

## ⚠️ Constraints & Timeline

**Timeline:**
- 14 days total for exposé (you're on Day 8-9)
- ~5-6 days remaining
- **Target:** Bibliography complete by Day 11-12
- **Goal:** Polishing + submission by Day 14

**Scope:**
- Current: Bachelor-level exposé (✅ complete)
- Next: 30-40 source bibliography (⏳ in progress)
- Final: German polish + LaTeX compilation + submission

**Dependencies:**
- Bibliography must be finalized before Chapter 1 writing (Phase 2)
- All papers must have Harvard citations before final PDF

## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions When Resuming

### Session 4 — START HERE

**Step 1: Search HIGH PRIORITY Papers (in order)**

```
Search and find:
1. Paper 10: CBA Methodology
   Search: "cost-benefit analysis" hydrogen infrastructure NPV
2. Paper 11: Barriers & Implementation
   Search: hydrogen infrastructure deployment barriers "chicken-and-egg"
3. Paper 4: EU Strategy
   Search: "hydrogen strategy for a carbon-neutral Europe" EC 2020
4. Paper 5: EU Roadmap
   Search: "Hydrogen Roadmap Europe" 2022 Hydrogen Europe
```

**Step 2: For Each Paper Found**

```
1. Download PDF
2. Save to: literature/ folder
3. Rename: AuthorYear_Topic.pdf

```

**Step 4: Compile Bibliography File**

```
Once 15+ papers validated:
- I generate references_h2.bib with all Harvard citations
- You integrate into expose_bachelor.tex
- Final LaTeX compilation
- German language polish
- Submit to professor
```
