## 📋 Search & Validation Workflow

**For Each Paper You Find:**

1. **Search** using exact queries from `literature/search_strategies for expose.md`
   - Google Scholar, ResearchGate, institutional repositories
   - Look for open-access versions or PDFs
   - Target peer-reviewed or official government documents

2. **Download & Save**
   - Place PDF in: `C:\Users\denny\Bachelorarbeit\literature\`
   - Name format: `AuthorYear_Topic.pdf` (e.g., `IEA2021_Future_Hydrogen.pdf`)

3. **Tell me:** "Found Paper X (title), file: [filename]"
   - I will review the PDF
   - Verify it matches thesis component
   - Assess quality and relevance
   - Extract Harvard citation metadata
   - Update BIBLIOGRAPHY_CHECKLIST.md with ✔ REVIEWED status

4. **Continue searching** while I validate previous papers
   - Parallel workflow = faster bibliography completion

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Use 15-core + 15-25-supporting model | Focused depth + supporting breadth for bachelor thesis | ✅ Approved |
| Search HIGH PRIORITY papers first (4 papers) | CBA, barriers, EU strategy are non-negotiable for thesis structure | ✅ Prioritized |
| You search, I validate workflow | You maintain paper selection control; I ensure quality + citations | ✅ Active workflow |
| Bachelor-level scope (6 chapters, ~50 pages) | Appropriate for bachelor thesis; manageable timeline | ✅ Confirmed |
| Benchmarking + CBA methodology | Objective regional comparison + economic viability quantification | ✅ Foundational |

## 🧠 Mental Context & Approach

### Why Bibliography is Critical Now

Your exposé structure is solid, but the bibliography is the **foundation** for credibility and thesis writing:

1. **CBA Methodology (Paper 10)** — You MUST have rigorous economic analysis framework
2. **Barriers Framework (Paper 11)** — Validates problem statement systematically
3. **EU Documents (Papers 4-5)** — Provide authoritative baseline for benchmarking
4. **Regional Papers (Papers 13-15)** — Enable meaningful comparison across 3 regions

Without these, thesis becomes generic. **With them**, analysis is evidence-based.

### The Bibliography as Your Thesis Backbone

```
Exposé Draft ✓ (done)
    ↓
Bibliography 30-40 sources ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
Chapter 1 (Einleitung) — Uses sources to frame problem
    ↓
Chapter 2 (Grundlagen) — Uses sources to explain concepts
    ↓
Chapter 3 (Methodik) — Uses CBA/benchmarking sources
    ↓
Chapter 4 (Ergebnisse) — Analysis grounded in source data
    ↓
Chapter 5 (Diskussion) — Uses sources for interpretation
    ↓
Chapter 6 (Fazit) — Uses sources for conclusions
```

Every chapter will reference your bibliography. Getting this right **now** saves time later.
