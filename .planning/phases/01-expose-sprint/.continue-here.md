## ⏳ Remaining Work (Days 8-14)

### Task 6: Expand Bibliography (Days 8-11) — **STARTING POINT FOR NEXT SESSION**

**Phase:** Bibliography Research & Validation

**Current:** 2/15 core papers found (METI 2023, NREL 2024)
**Target:** 15/15 core papers + 15-25 supporting papers = 30-40 total sources

**Search Priority Order:**

| Priority | Papers | Task | Status |
|----------|--------|------|--------|
| 🔴 HIGH | 10, 11, 4, 5 | Find CBA methodology, barriers, EU strategy docs | ⏳ NEXT |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 9, 13, 14, 15 | Find supply chain & regional comparison papers | ⏳ After high priority |
| 🟢 LOWER | 1, 2, 3, 8, 12 | Find supplementary papers if time permits | ⏳ Fill gaps |

**Workflow for Each Paper Search:**

1. **Search** using exact queries from `search_strategies for expose.md`
   - Example for Paper 10 (CBA): `"cost-benefit analysis" hydrogen infrastructure NPV`
   - Alternative: `hydrogen infrastructure economic viability CBA`
   - Check Google Scholar, ResearchGate, institutional repositories
   - Look for open-access versions if paywall appears

2. **Download** PDF and save to: `C:\Users\denny\Bachelorarbeit\literature\`
   - Naming convention: `AuthorYear_Topic.pdf` (e.g., `IEA2021_Future_Hydrogen.pdf`)

3. **Tell me:** "Found Paper X (title), file in literature folder"

4. **I validate:**
   - Read PDF abstract/intro
   - Verify it matches intended thesis component
   - Assess quality and relevance
   - Extract Harvard citation metadata
   - Confirm "REVIEWED ✔" status

5. **Update BIBLIOGRAPHY_CHECKLIST.md** with:
   - Status changed from "PENDING" to "✅ FOUND" then "✔ REVIEWED"
   - Filename and source
   - Harvard citation

**Priority for Next Session:**

**Start with HIGH PRIORITY papers (essential for thesis core):**

1. **Paper 10 — CBA Methodology**
   - Search: `"cost-benefit analysis" hydrogen infrastructure NPV 2024`
   - What to find: Framework paper on economic viability assessment
   - Why: You MUST have rigorous CBA methodology for your thesis

2. **Paper 11 — Barriers & Implementation Strategies**
   - Search: `hydrogen infrastructure deployment barriers "chicken-and-egg" 2024`
   - What to find: Systematic analysis of deployment barriers + solutions
   - Why: Core to your problem statement and recommendations

3. **Paper 4 — EU Strategy (2020)**
   - Search: `"hydrogen strategy for a carbon-neutral Europe" EC 2020`
   - What to find: Official EU Commission policy document
   - Why: Foundation for European regional benchmark

4. **Paper 5 — EU Roadmap (2022)**
   - Search: `"Hydrogen Roadmap Europe" 2022 Hydrogen Europe`
   - What to find: Infrastructure implementation roadmap
   - Why: Complements EU strategy with concrete infrastructure targets

---

### Task 7: Polish & Submit (Days 11-14)

**Once bibliography is complete:**
- Academic German review (formal register, active voice)
- Concept Map clarity check
- Terminology consistency
- Final LaTeX compilation
- Submit to professor

---

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made (This Session)

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Scrap current 11-source bibliography** | Sources are too generic for H₂-infrastructure focus; need specialized papers | ✅ Approved |
| **Use 15-core + 15-25-supporting model** | Provides both focused depth and supporting breadth for bachelor thesis | ✅ Approved |
| **Search HIGH PRIORITY papers first (4 papers)** | CBA, barriers, EU strategy are non-negotiable for thesis structure | ✅ Prioritized |
| **You search, I validate workflow** | You maintain control of paper selection; I ensure quality/relevance | ✅ Workflow set |

---

## 📋 Bibliography Rebuild Workflow

**You handle:** Paper discovery (using search strategies guide)
**I handle:** Quality validation + Harvard citations + checklist updates

**Communication:**
- You: "Found Paper 4 and Paper 9, files in literature/"
- Me: Reviews both, provides feedback:
  - ✅ CONFIRMED: "Paper 4 is exactly right. Harvard citation: [data]"
  - ⚠️ PARTIAL: "Paper 9 is good but better as supporting source"
  - ✖️ REJECTED: "Paper 9 doesn't match scope, try alternative search"
- Me: Updates BIBLIOGRAPHY_CHECKLIST.md with new status
- You: Continue to next search while I review

---

## 🧠 Mental Context & Approach

### Why This Matters for Your Thesis

Your exposé is solid, but the bibliography is the **foundation** for credibility:

1. **CBA Methodology (Paper 10)** — You need this to design your economic analysis rigor
2. **Barriers Framework (Paper 11)** — Validates your problem statement systematically
3. **EU documents (Papers 4-5)** — Provide authoritative baseline for your benchmarking
4. **Regional papers (Papers 13-15)** — Enable meaningful comparison across EU, Asia-Pac, Australia

Without these, your thesis becomes generic. **With them**, your analysis is evidence-based and credible.

### The Bibliography as Your Thesis Backbone

```
Exposé Draft ✓ (done)
    ↓
Bibliography 30-40 sources ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
Chapter 1 (Einleitung) — Uses sources to frame problem
    ↓
Chapter 2 (Grundlagen) — Uses sources to explain concepts
    ↓
Chapter 3 (Methodik) — Uses CBA/benchmarking sources
    ↓
Chapter 4 (Ergebnisse) — Analysis grounded in source data
    ↓
Chapter 5-6 (Diskussion/Fazit) — Discussion uses sources
```

Every chapter will reference your bibliography extensively. Getting this right **now** saves time later.

**Step 1: Bibliography Search Phase**
```
Search HIGH PRIORITY papers (in order):
1. Paper 10: CBA Methodology
   - Search: "cost-benefit analysis" hydrogen infrastructure NPV
2. Paper 11: Barriers & Implementation
   - Search: hydrogen infrastructure deployment barriers "chicken-and-egg"
3. Paper 4: EU Strategy
   - Search: "hydrogen strategy for a carbon-neutral Europe" EC 2020
4. Paper 5: EU Roadmap
   - Search: "Hydrogen Roadmap Europe" 2022 Hydrogen Europe
```

**Step 2: For Each Paper Found**
```
- Download PDF → literature/ folder
- Rename: AuthorYear_Topic.pdf
- Tell me: "Found Paper X, file: [filename]"
- I validate + update checklist
```

**Step 3: Then Search MEDIUM PRIORITY Papers**
```
(Papers 9, 13, 14, 15 — same workflow)
```

**Step 4: Compile & Polish**
```
Once 15+ papers validated:
- I generate references_h2.bib with all Harvard citations
- You integrate into expose_bachelor.tex
- Final compilation + language review
- Submit to professor
```
