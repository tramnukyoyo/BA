## Work In Progress

### Phase 1, Week 2: Final Refinement (Days 8-14)

**What's Ready:**
- Complete 8-chapter structure
- 11 baseline bibliography sources
- LaTeX compilation working
- PDF generation successful

**What Needs Attention:**
- **Research Question Validation** — Do the 3 RQs match YOUR vision?
  - RQ1: Technical/economic viability?
  - RQ2: Governance/coordination mechanisms?
  - RQ3: Sustainability trade-offs?
  - ⚠️ Current versions are generic — need your approval

- **Bibliography Enhancement** — 11 sources → 15+ (H₂-specific focus)
  - Current sources are real but generic
  - Need to add: H2Future project, HyDelta, HEAVENN, national H₂ strategies
  - Action: 3-5 new hydrogen infrastructure papers

- **Ausgangslage Refinement** — Add specific examples
  - Current: Generic problem statement
  - Needed: 2-3 specific hydrogen projects/statistics
  - Examples: EU Hydrogen Backbone, Japan/Korea H₂ import, Australia export plans

- **Scope Validation** — Is 8 chapters appropriate?
  - Current: 8 chapters (now expanded to full thesis structure with Chapters 1-8)
  - Note: SWOT and Nutzwertanalyse add 2-3 pages per chapter
  - Total pages: ~83 pages (within bachelor thesis norms)
  - Action: Confirm scope is manageable

- **Language Polish** — German academic register
  - Format: Formal German, active voice ("Ich analysiere...")
  - Action: Review for consistency and clarity

- **⭐ NEW: SWOT Analysis Preparation** — Framework definition
  - Define criteria and structure for 3 SWOT analyses (scenarios, regions, governance)
  - Create evaluation criteria and scoring guidelines
  - Action: Phase 2 task (during foundation work)

- **⭐ NEW: Nutzwertanalyse Preparation** — Scoring matrix development
  - Define 8-10 evaluation criteria for ranking scenarios
  - Create weighted scoring scale
  - Action: Phase 2 task (during foundation work)

## Recent Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Use 8-chapter structure | Comprehensive coverage of all dimensions | ⚠️ Needs validation (too big?) |
| 3 hierarchical RQs | Scope management through nested questions | — Pending user confirmation |
| Peer template as reference | Fast-track exposé generation | ✓ Worked well |
| Harvard + BibTeX | UDE template requirement | ✓ Working |
| 11 baseline sources | Quick foundation for draft | ⚠️ Needs expansion to H₂-specific |
| **NEW:** Add SWOT Analysis (3 dimensions) | Systematic evaluation framework for scenarios, regions, governance | ✓ Approved — integrated into Phases 2-4 |
| **NEW:** Add Nutzwertanalyse for scenario ranking | Evidence-based utility analysis for implementation prioritization | ✓ Approved — main analysis in Chapter 6 |
| **NEW:** Expand to 8-chapter structure with Chapters 6-8 | Add Sustainability/Impact, Discussion, Summary chapters for completeness | ✓ Approved — timeline extended, total ~83 pages |

---

## Blockers & Concerns

- ⚠️ **RQ Alignment:** Current research questions are generic H₂ framework questions. Need validation that they match YOUR specific thesis focus.
- ⚠️ **Scope Creep:** 8 chapters may be too ambitious for bachelor thesis. Need confirmation on what's essential vs. what could be consolidated.
- ⚠️ **Bibliography Specificity:** Current sources are real but not focused on hydrogen infrastructure. Need at least 5 hydrogen-specific papers before submission.

## Session Continuity

**Last activity:** 2026-01-31 16:30 UTC+1 — Completed exposé draft, paused for user review

**Current checkpoint:** `.continue-here.md` created with full context

**Resumption plan:** Next session should:
1. Open `expose/expose.pdf` and review
2. Validate 3 RQs against your vision
3. Update bibliography with H₂-specific sources
4. Enhance Ausgangslage with examples
5. Polish German language
6. Submit to professor

   - Assess structure coherence
   - Check if content direction feels right

2. **Validate research questions**
   - Do the 3 RQs match YOUR thesis focus?
   - Are they specific enough?
   - Do they address the right dimensions?

3. **Update bibliography**
   - Add 3-5 hydrogen infrastructure papers
   - Focus on: governance, infrastructure, deployment strategies
   - Expand from 11 → 15-20 sources

4. **Enhance Ausgangslage**
   - Add 2-3 specific H₂ project examples
   - Include regional initiative statistics
   - Make problem statement more concrete

### Medium (Days 11-12)

5. **Polish German language**
   - Formal register check
   - Active voice consistency
   - Terminology consistency

6. **Validate scope**
   - Is 8 chapters appropriate?
   - Should any chapters be consolidated?
   - Confirm feasibility for bachelor thesis

### Final (Days 13-14)

7. **Compile final PDF**
   - Run LaTeX compilation
   - Verify all citations render
   - Check PDF formatting

8. **Prepare for submission**
   - Create `expose/exposé-final.pdf`
