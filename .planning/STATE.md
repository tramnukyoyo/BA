## Phase 1 Rebuild Rationale (Session 6)

**Decision:** Rebuild Phase 1 Exposé with **HRS-Specific Focus**

**Why Rebuild?**
- Original exposé addressed "Regional Hydrogen Infrastructure" (too broad: production, storage, transmission pipelines, refueling)
- User's actual thesis is specifically about **Hydrogen Refueling Station (HRS) Implementation**
- Original 10 papers not aligned with HRS-specific requirements
- Need to sharpen focus from general H₂ infrastructure to HRS deployment challenges

**What Changed:**
- **Thesis Title:** "Wasserstoffinfrastruktur in globalen Lieferketten" → "Wasserstofftankstellen in globalen Lieferketten" (HRS focus)
- **Content Areas:** Redefined 10 content areas specifically for HRS (e.g., "HRS Supply Chain Integration," "HRS Spatial Planning," "HRS Regulatory Frameworks")
- **Barriers Framework:** Changed from 4 generic barriers to **3 HRS-specific barrier categories**: Regulatory, Logistical, Technical
- **Scenarios:** Added HRS-specific integration scenarios: Corridor-based (highway HRS), Urban Clusters (city networks), Industry Hubs (ports/logistics)
- **Papers:** Will search for **10 NEW core papers**, one per content area, all HRS-specific (2019-2025)
- **Concept Map:** Replaced text-based boxes with **hierarchical bullet-point framework** (clearer structure)

**Deliverables Created (Session 6):**
1. ✓ `literature/SEARCH_STRATEGY_HRS.md` — 10 targeted search queries with quality criteria
2. ✓ `literature/PAPER_CANDIDATES.md` — Tracking template for 30-50 candidate papers
3. ✓ `expose/FRAMEWORK_DESIGN.md` — Design document for new bullet-point framework
4. ✓ `expose/expose_bachelor.tex` — Restructured with HRS focus (Ausgangslage, Problemstellung, RQs, Gliederung all updated)
5. ✓ `expose/references_h2_CORE.bib` — BibTeX template for 10 new core papers
6. ✓ `expose/references_h2_OLD.bib` — Renamed old 10 papers as supplementary

**Next Steps (User-Driven):**
1. Execute 10 targeted searches in Google Scholar/ScienceDirect using SEARCH_STRATEGY_HRS.md
2. Track candidates in PAPER_CANDIDATES.md (aim for 30-50 total)
3. Evaluate using quality checklist, select best 10 (1 per content area)
4. Fill in references_h2_CORE.bib with final 10 papers
5. Integrate citations throughout expose_bachelor.tex
6. Compile and verify PDF

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-3: Execute searches, track candidates
- Days 4-7: Evaluate, select final 10 papers, create core bibliography
- Days 8-10: Integrate into exposé, compile final PDF

## Work In Progress

### Phase 1, Week 2: Final Refinement (Days 8-14)

**What's Ready:**
- Complete 8-chapter structure
- 11 baseline bibliography sources
- LaTeX compilation working
- PDF generation successful

**What Needs Attention:**
- **Research Question Validation** — Do the 3 RQs match YOUR vision?
  - RQ1: Technical/economic viability?
  - RQ2: Governance/coordination mechanisms?
  - RQ3: Sustainability trade-offs?
  - ⚠️ Current versions are generic — need your approval

- **Bibliography Enhancement** — 11 sources → 15+ (H₂-specific focus)
  - Current sources are real but generic
  - Need to add: H2Future project, HyDelta, HEAVENN, national H₂ strategies
  - Action: 3-5 new hydrogen infrastructure papers

- **Ausgangslage Refinement** — Add specific examples
  - Current: Generic problem statement
  - Needed: 2-3 specific hydrogen projects/statistics
  - Examples: EU Hydrogen Backbone, Japan/Korea H₂ import, Australia export plans

- **Scope Validation** — Is 8 chapters appropriate?
  - Current: 8 chapters (now expanded to full thesis structure with Chapters 1-8)
  - Note: SWOT and Nutzwertanalyse add 2-3 pages per chapter
  - Total pages: ~83 pages (within bachelor thesis norms)
  - Action: Confirm scope is manageable

- **Language Polish** — German academic register
  - Format: Formal German, active voice ("Ich analysiere...")
  - Action: Review for consistency and clarity

- **⭐ NEW: SWOT Analysis Preparation** — Framework definition
  - Define criteria and structure for 3 SWOT analyses (scenarios, regions, governance)
  - Create evaluation criteria and scoring guidelines
  - Action: Phase 2 task (during foundation work)

- **⭐ NEW: Nutzwertanalyse Preparation** — Scoring matrix development
  - Define 8-10 evaluation criteria for ranking scenarios
  - Create weighted scoring scale
  - Action: Phase 2 task (during foundation work)

## Recent Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **REBUILD Phase 1 with HRS-specific focus** | Original too broad (general H₂ infrastructure), actual thesis is about HRS deployment | ✓ Approved & in progress |
| Find 10 NEW HRS-focused core papers | Original papers not aligned with HRS-specific thesis focus | ✓ Approved — search strategy created |
| 10 Content Areas for paper selection | Ensures balanced coverage (1 paper per area) and no redundancy | ✓ Approved |
| Replace concept map with bullet-point framework | Text-box format unclear, bullets clearer for exposé format | ✓ Design complete, awaiting paper integration |
| Keep old 10 papers as supplementary | Useful background context, not core | ✓ Approved |
| 3 HRS-specific barrier categories | Regulatory, Logistical, Technical (instead of 4 generic) | ✓ Implemented in expose_bachelor.tex |
| 3 HRS integration scenarios | Corridor-based, Urban Clusters, Industry Hubs | ✓ Implemented in gliederung section |
| Use 8-chapter structure | Comprehensive coverage of all dimensions | ⚠️ Needs validation (too big?) |
| 3 hierarchical RQs (HRS-focused) | Scope management through nested questions on HRS deployment | ⏳ Pending final paper integration |
| Harvard + BibTeX | UDE template requirement | ✓ Working |
| **NEW:** Add SWOT Analysis (3 dimensions) | Systematic evaluation framework for scenarios, regions, governance | ✓ Approved — integrated into Phases 2-4 |
| **NEW:** Add Nutzwertanalyse for scenario ranking | Evidence-based utility analysis for implementation prioritization | ✓ Approved — main analysis in Chapter 6 |

---

## Blockers & Concerns

- ⚠️ **RQ Alignment:** Current research questions are generic H₂ framework questions. Need validation that they match YOUR specific thesis focus.
- ⚠️ **Scope Creep:** 8 chapters may be too ambitious for bachelor thesis. Need confirmation on what's essential vs. what could be consolidated.
- ⚠️ **Bibliography Specificity:** Current sources are real but not focused on hydrogen infrastructure. Need at least 5 hydrogen-specific papers before submission.
