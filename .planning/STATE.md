## Work In Progress

### Phase 1, Week 2: Final Refinement (Days 8-14)

**What's Ready:**
- Complete 8-chapter structure
- 11 baseline bibliography sources
- LaTeX compilation working
- PDF generation successful

**What Needs Attention:**
- **Research Question Validation** — Do the 3 RQs match YOUR vision?
  - RQ1: Technical/economic viability?
  - RQ2: Governance/coordination mechanisms?
  - RQ3: Sustainability trade-offs?
  - ⚠️ Current versions are generic — need your approval

- **Bibliography Enhancement** — 11 sources → 15+ (H₂-specific focus)
  - Current sources are real but generic
  - Need to add: H2Future project, HyDelta, HEAVENN, national H₂ strategies
  - Action: 3-5 new hydrogen infrastructure papers

- **Ausgangslage Refinement** — Add specific examples
  - Current: Generic problem statement
  - Needed: 2-3 specific hydrogen projects/statistics
  - Examples: EU Hydrogen Backbone, Japan/Korea H₂ import, Australia export plans

- **Scope Validation** — Is 8 chapters appropriate?
  - Current: 8 chapters (now expanded to full thesis structure with Chapters 1-8)
  - Note: SWOT and Nutzwertanalyse add 2-3 pages per chapter
  - Total pages: ~83 pages (within bachelor thesis norms)
  - Action: Confirm scope is manageable

- **Language Polish** — German academic register
  - Format: Formal German, active voice ("Ich analysiere...")
  - Action: Review for consistency and clarity

- **⭐ NEW: SWOT Analysis Preparation** — Framework definition
  - Define criteria and structure for 3 SWOT analyses (scenarios, regions, governance)
  - Create evaluation criteria and scoring guidelines
  - Action: Phase 2 task (during foundation work)

- **⭐ NEW: Nutzwertanalyse Preparation** — Scoring matrix development
  - Define 8-10 evaluation criteria for ranking scenarios
  - Create weighted scoring scale
  - Action: Phase 2 task (during foundation work)

## Recent Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Use 8-chapter structure | Comprehensive coverage of all dimensions | ⚠️ Needs validation (too big?) |
| 3 hierarchical RQs | Scope management through nested questions | — Pending user confirmation |
| Peer template as reference | Fast-track exposé generation | ✓ Worked well |
| Harvard + BibTeX | UDE template requirement | ✓ Working |
| 11 baseline sources | Quick foundation for draft | ⚠️ Needs expansion to H₂-specific |
| **NEW:** Add SWOT Analysis (3 dimensions) | Systematic evaluation framework for scenarios, regions, governance | ✓ Approved — integrated into Phases 2-4 |
| **NEW:** Add Nutzwertanalyse for scenario ranking | Evidence-based utility analysis for implementation prioritization | ✓ Approved — main analysis in Chapter 6 |
| **NEW:** Expand to 8-chapter structure with Chapters 6-8 | Add Sustainability/Impact, Discussion, Summary chapters for completeness | ✓ Approved — timeline extended, total ~83 pages |

---

## Blockers & Concerns

- ⚠️ **RQ Alignment:** Current research questions are generic H₂ framework questions. Need validation that they match YOUR specific thesis focus.
- ⚠️ **Scope Creep:** 8 chapters may be too ambitious for bachelor thesis. Need confirmation on what's essential vs. what could be consolidated.
- ⚠️ **Bibliography Specificity:** Current sources are real but not focused on hydrogen infrastructure. Need at least 5 hydrogen-specific papers before submission.
