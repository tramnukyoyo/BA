## v2 Requirements

Deferred to potential follow-up work (not in current thesis scope).

- **FUTURE-01**: Comparative analysis of H₂ infrastructure in specific regions (detailed case studies)
- **FUTURE-02**: Economic modeling tool for regional H₂ infrastructure ROI assessment
- **FUTURE-03**: Real-time monitoring framework for pilot projects
- **FUTURE-04**: Interactive visualization of global H₂ supply chains
- **FUTURE-05**: Impact assessment tool for policy interventions

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Conduct original LCA studies | Use existing published LCA data, not original experiments |
| Analyze proprietary industry cost data | Limited to published sources, IEA, NREL, McKinsey data |
| Develop working H₂ technology prototypes | Research thesis, not engineering project |
| Create real-time market price tracking | Beyond thesis scope, separate tool project |
| Comprehensive global patent review | Focus on implementation strategies, not IP landscape |
| Model-based optimization of supply chains | Qualitative framework, not quantitative modeling |
